I am afraid the left ch has failed, pfl will give you mono on monitor and headphone outputs ( but both sides of led metering will indicate signal ) It would be best if you could return the mixer.
Btw. I use epm 12, it is really nice sounding mixer, a had zed before
 
I have the same problem but with the Monitor out when recording into Ableton, Mix levels on the mixer are totally fine, with L&R playing and displaying perfectly, but when I record from the Monitor level only into Ableton, the sound comes from the R channel only, while mix L&R levels and Phones levels are still playing perfectly fine on the mixer and in the headphones.
