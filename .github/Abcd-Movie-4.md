We seek a part-time licensed providers to join our group. We value our collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to providing care to a wide range of child, adolescent, and adult patients, and are open to psychiatrists, psychologists, applied behavior analysts, SLPs, or MFTs. ABCD has a wide referral base and provides a collegial work environment with reception and bookkeeping/billing support. Health insurance and retirement plans are available for individual enrollment once a trial period is completed. If interested, please contact Dr. Brian Neville at bneville@abcdseattle.com or Dr. Madeline Frank at mfrank@abcdeattle.com.
 
With nearly $290M of new funding for seven years to research institutions around the country, the National Institutes of Health renewed its commitment to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (ABCD Study) the largest long-term study of brain development and child health ever conducted in the United States.

All data access information is documented on the NDA ABCD Featured Dataset page and includes pointers to an external ABCD Study wiki where data release notes and general information about the data resource are provided. All users should review the release notes for detailed information on the released data. Note that with the change to how release notes are made available, they will be updated regularly and thus users are advised to check -notes/start-page.html for the most up-to-date information. Release notes for qualified users only (i.e., non-public) are available at =2147. The 5.0 data ontology and dictionary can be viewed at -dict.abcdstudy.org/.
 
The table below highlights key differences between the 4.0 and 5.0 data releases. Note that the Data Exploration and Analysis Portal (DEAP) has been decommissioned as of June 1, 2023. In addition, study creation no longer works with how the data are shared this year. We anticipate reinstating it with the 6.0 data release.
 
This special issue of ChildArt introduces the intersection of the arts and neuroscience through an overview of the ABCD Study. It presents some of the data from the study, as well as other research looking at the impact of the arts on child development. The issue combines the work of experts in neuroscience, world renowned artists, specialists in child development, and others. Topics covered include the juncture between the arts and human culture, the developing adolescent brain, the interaction between cultural and biological processes and artistic creation, the interface of the arts and science as a multisensory experience, insights from the neuroscience of dance and music, and more. We hope that this special issue will stimulate creativity and innovation in research on the impact of the arts on child development as well as encourage researchers to leverage the ABCD Study data to advance research on a wide range of other topics.
 
Please note: The ABCD study is assessing brain development in children throughout adolescence, while tracking social, behavioral, physical and environmental factors that may affect brain development and other health outcomes. Screen time is only one of many measures evaluated as part of the study protocol.

While a neighborhood might have deficits like boarded-up storefronts and unemployment, McKnight realized that it also had untapped assets including the skills of local residents and the local clubs and associations, as well as small businesses. He found these local assets could contribute to making the neighborhood a better place if they were asked.

An overview of the ABCD Study can be found at abcdstudy.org and detailed descriptions of the assessment protocols are available at ABCD Protocols. This page provides important general information about the ABCD 5.1 data release.
 
Release 5.1 contains tabulated data and minimally processed imaging data for visits started between September 1, 2016 and January 15, 2022. It includes data from 11,868 participants, the entire ABCD cohort (N = 11,880) except for twelve participants who withdrew consent to share their data, and nine events. Events up to the 3-year follow-up event are completed, with varying numbers of missed visits per event; the 42-month and 4-year follow-up events were still ongoing when the data for this release was frozen, so data are included for a subset of participants for these timepoints.
 
The 5.1 Patch Release addressed some issues from the 5.0 Data Release. There are some discrepancies between the 5.0 and 5.1 Data, due to changes that were made, but 5.1 Data is the most up to date. Here are the updates for 5.1:
 
The new online format allows ABCD to update the release notes more frequently. ABCD will work to continuously improve the resource, include additional information, and will likely add more features like an FAQ section.
 
ABCD has started a process to curate the data resource in a more consistent and standardized manner. As a first step, ABCD developed a standard for naming data tables that was implemented in the 5.0 release. This standard takes into account two hierarchy levels that every table can be assigned to:
 
In addition to changing table names, ABCD also reconsidered the way in which variables are grouped into different tables. On the one hand, this involved breaking up tables that previously contained a large number of variables into several tables with a smaller, more coherent set of variables (e.g., in the Imaging domain). On the other hand, it involved combining variables with consistent content from previously separate tables into one table, especially,
 
The accompanying data dictionary explorer application allows users to explore the structure of the ABCD data resource in an interactive manner (see above). It illustrates how variables are grouped into the new tables and how tables are hierarchically organized within the ABCD ontology. For backward-compatibility, the application also allows users to look up the table names as well as DEAP variable names used in the 4.0 release. As such, users can search for a variable name or a 4.0 table name in the interactive data dictionary table and see which table this variable now belongs to (for more information on how to use the application, see Data Dictionary Explorer).
 
ABCD hopes that the standardization and reorganization of tables will improve the overall user experience and make it easier to find related variables and constructs in the dataset. As a next step in the efforts to make the data resource more consistent and standardized and as an extension of the new table naming scheme, ABCD plans to develop a standardized naming scheme for all variables in the resource.
 
All tabulated data files are provided as one zip archive file with approximately 5 GB in size (15 GB after extraction). After extracting the archive, the root directory will contain several subdirectories grouping the data files by domain. The tables are provided as plain text files (.csv) that can be imported into any statistical software for analysis.
 
This is an unexpected and potentially misleading behavior because it suggests that the data is based on actual participant behavior/choices. Especially when users only consider one of the response options for their analysis, the old format might result in misinterpretation and wrongful inclusion of cases. In the 5.0 release, we decided to export the data using an alternative method which results in the following output format:
 
In response to COVID-19 restrictions beginning in March 2020, ABCD pivoted to remote testing when in-person testing was not possible or feasible and subsequently a hybrid in-person/remote testing procedure as sites allowed. This affects all annual assessments conducted in March 2020 or later (in the 5.0 release, those are 2-, 3, and 4-year follow-up visits).
 
Note: To determine the visit type for a given participant/event, e.g., to account for it in statistical analyses, the Longitudinal Tracking instrument (abcd\_y\_lt) includes the variable visit\_type that codes the assessment setting in the following manner:
 
We are sharing the Spanish language descriptions of items, but due to technical limitations of the export process (no support for UTF-8) the Spanish language content appeared broken in the NDA data dictionaries. As the 5.0 data dictionary is based on these data dictionaries, this is still the case. We are planning to fix the Spanish content in the data dictionary explorer application. For the meantime, we hope that the visible content is sufficient to inform the reader about the Spanish wording of questions. Please contact the ABCD Coordinating Center (CC) if you require access to the original Spanish language version of REDCap instruments.
 
Due to the different time frame and wording of the baseline and follow-up questions, distinct variables were used to capture these data. To indicate the association, the suffix \_l was added to the baseline variable name to create the longitudinal variable name used in follow-up events (e.g., a baseline variable named drug\_used would be named drug\_used\_l as a longitudinal variable). While baseline and longitudinal variables were originally shared in separate tables, they were combined in the new table structure (see above) to m
