Nevertheless, an age-old question has to be mentioned, "**Is online video converter safe to use?**" Actually, it's a controversial issue that really varies by cases. So in the following content, I can only speak from my perspective, but more objective.

Is Online Video Converter safe to use? There are two types of ambiguity. On the one hand, it specifically refers to a famous website OnlineVideoConverter.com that is well known as a YouTube downloader and converter. On the other hand, it also generally refers to all online video format conversion services of this sort. So this post will be divided into two parts to discuss the details respectively.
 
There is no need to rummage around the web for an alternative to OnlineVideoConverter. Free HD Video Converter Factory is a well-equipped combination of a video converter and a video downloader, which offers a one-stop solution to online video download and format conversion. Download and install it to explore more surprises. It's 100% free, clean, safe, and easy-to-use.
 
Well, OnlineVideoConverter.com, well known as OVC, is a long-standing free online media conversion web application that allows you to convert any video URL or file to various formats without the need to install any software on your computer. This website has been verified by some Web Security Checkers like Google Transparency Report, Web Of Trust (WOT), Norton Safe Web, VirusTotal, etc. **So theoretically, OnlineVideoConverter is safe to use.**

However, you know that, OnlineVideoConverter benefits from various ADs placed on each webpage to maintain the free service. If you have an AD blocking program installed, you probably don't feel anything. But if not, when clicked on the AD, you may be redirected to other malicious pages, pop-ups or trigger execution of scripts designed to download and install malware. That's the reason why a few people raised doubts about this website.
 
But anyway, the most-visited OnlineVideoConverter.com have been closed down for a while. It's not accessible and only shows 502 Bad Gateway. Meanwhile, there are quite a lot of imitators springing up in the name of OnlineVideoConverter in the SERPs. I've no idea which one is rebuilt by the originally group. To ensure safety, install an AD blocker and don't click on any AD.
 
Sometimes you need to change video format to solve incompatibility issue temporarily but don't want to install software. In this case, many people will turn to some free online video converter services instead of unnecessary trouble. So are these services safe? Not exactly! There are still many websites with a lot of intrusive ADs, browser hijackers, adware or plug-ins implanted under the banner of free.
 
However, I personally don't recommend the online video conversion service, because you have to spend a lot of time on uploading videos, waiting for the conversion, and then downloading back to local drive. The speed depends on your network connection and website server, let alone the video size limit for uploading. If you agree with my opinion, read on for a surefire solution.
 
You know many stream-ripping sites have been shut down following legal action for copyright infringement. It's well-advised to download and convert video using a desktop program. **Free HD Video Converter Factory** is the right one I would like to recommend based on three points: free & clean, convert video/audio offline and download online videos/music.
 
Run Free HD Video Converter Factory and open "**Downloader**". Click "**New Download**" button to create your first download task. On the new window, copy and paste the YouTube video URL for analyzing, it will display the video resolution, format and file size below. It also supports parsing URLs for YouTube playlist and channel. Select one option and click **OK** to add it to download list. Specify an output folder to save the downloaded videos, at last, hit "**Download All**" to start the downloading. In addition to YouTube, this freeware allows you to save videos from Facebook, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Soundcloud and 1000+ hot websites.
 
To convert video file format, close Downloader and go back to main interface, open "**Converter**". Import the downloaded videos to the program. Select an output format from 500+ ready-made presets on the right side. Set an output directory on the bottom and hit "**Run**" button to start the conversion. Moreover, you're able to make some basic video editing like trimming, splitting, merging, rotating, watermarking, etc., and even customize video parameters as you wish.
 
Now you're supposed to have a clue about online video converter safe issue. By contrast, Free HD Video Converter Factory deserves the recommendation with both video converter and downloader features. It will never let you down if you're looking for an OnlineVideoConverter alternative. Cheers!
 
If you are a content creator who works with various video formats, you have to deal with videos every day in your life.

Some free online video converter tools could help you resolve this problem easily. But are those tools safe enough for protecting your privacy?
 
To avoid such things happening, the most effective way is to try to not convert your sensitive video with those online tools. If you need to do that, try a program that is reliable. There are lots of video converter software you can get in the market, and among them, **WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe** can be the best one.
 
You can even use this video converter to create your photos into slideshow videos. Just input your photos (make sure they are in a file folder), then choose the output format, add some background music if you like, then run it. With this photo slideshow maker, you can share these videos with your friends and family.
