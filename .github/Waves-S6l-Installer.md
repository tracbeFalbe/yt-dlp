You must download an older version of an offline installer that matches the version of your plugins that you want to install. In a ZIP file of that offline installer you will find the install.cen file. It is there - I downloaded all older versions, from v10 to v13 and checked.

Well, most are in. All my V. 14 plugs are unavailable in Studio One, despite having reinstalled them, per the instructions to use Waves Central. Tells me they are not installed. Have restarted computer, but still no luck.

Dear all,
I have tried to install A@H waves card driver for dLive on a new pc with Win11 operation system.
1st of all it is a driver from 2017 not updated since, which contains an old Waves Central and SoundGrid application that is installed at the same time. At least it is the driver i have found after long research.
 
By restarting my computer I got a win11 blue screen.
After some tests i have identified the problem on the start of the SG application.
Can somebody gives advise how to get the waves card works on win11?
 
Do you have a link or version for the driver you have installed? You might be trying to install a legacy version. The current version should be available for installation and activation through the latest Waves Central.
 
In the meantime I have reached to run SG studio application.
It request un driver update for the M-DL-WAVES3 card.
I do not know where to get this update, as the old waves console will not connect to the internet.
The waves central offline installation is requesting to browse to a data file I do not know where to find. The data package downloaded with the offline waves central will not link into.
 
Instead, the installation is run by a pneumatic system housed in the garage underneath the courtyard. It has settings that change the timing, pressure, and height of the waves, which can be set to break as high as twelve feet into the air.

If you are interested in large-scale JRPGs with cel-shaded graphics similar to Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves should be in your sights. Released last month, Wuthering Waves is an open-world JRPG with real-time combat, with a gacha system similar to games like Genshin Impact. But with a nicer movement system and a more forgiving gacha mechanic, I ended up enjoying Wuthering Waves more. So, in this guide, we are going to go over how to get it running on your Steam Deck!
 
Launch the installer and go through the steps to install the game. There's no need to change any settings and can just install as is. Once this is done, do NOT press Start when done, and instead close the launcher for the time being.
 
The installation of Wuthering Waves creates a new file in the compatdata you will need to go into, but the numbers are randomized on every device. To find it, go to the 3 horizontal bar button at the top right of the window and sort the folders by "Created." This will put the most recently created file/folder at the bottom right.
 
Once you click on the folder at the top left, head into the pfx > drive\_c > Wuthering Waves folder. Here, you will find the launcher.exe, but we won't be adding it to Steam directly. Instead, right click on the launcher.exe and click "Copy Location.'
 
Now go ahead to your Wuthering Waves installer on Steam that we have before and go to the preferences. You are going to paste the location we just copied into both the "Target" and "Launch In" boxes there.
 
As a quick note, you will need to keep the quotation marks for both boxes, so I recommend posting the location in the "Target" box first in between the quotation marks, then copying the entirety of that into the "Launch In" box. You will also need to delete the "launcher.exe" from this box so the ends will look something like this:
 
Once that's done, go ahead and start the launcher again. You will have to download the game, and then once it is done, go ahead and launch it. It will download a few more files and then you will have to restart the game. After that, you should be good to close this and head into Gaming Mode.
 
The game should be all ready to go, but you will need to log in. Once you start the game, go ahead and log in. The game may crash after this, and if it does, it is perfectly normal. Just go ahead and restart the game and it will auto log you in.
 
If you are using a Google account to log in, you will need to install Google Chrome from the Discover Store in Desktop mode. Start Chrome and log into Wuthering Waves' website, then when you log in later in Game mode, it should automatically recognize and you will be good to go.
 
And that's it! You are now able to play Wuthering Waves on your Steam Deck. Again, while this is technically supported, there is a small risk of being banned. I would not be worried about it personally, but the risk is there because it is not made playable on Linux. Keep this in mind moving forward.
 
As for performance, the most stable and battery-saving way to play will be via 30 FPS on the very low settings. It seems 45 FPS might be possible, but I did find some areas with drops, so I preferred to keep it at 30. Overall, it's a great way to play the game and I know playing on the Steam Deck will be my preferred way for sure!

Due to its particular features, any space has a way of relating with sounds, understanding sound like a series of compressions and decompressions which move through the air, so that the geometry of the space itself and the elements in it will influence the movements of the sound and finally our perception of it.
 
The installation examines how we interpret our position in a sonic landscape. The room and its elements create a stationary system for the sound to travel through, but the most minimal movement on our part creates a chaos of infinite variables.
 
Depending on how we may act in front of it, according to the number of observers and their movements, it will pass from a steady line without sound to chaotic shapes of irregular sounds (the more movement there is around the installation) through the different phases of sinusoidal waves and harmonic sounds; examining the action-reaction principle applied to sound and space.
 
The installation uses two motors to oscillate a length of rope creating a visual reminiscent of a digital waveform while creating its whipping hum from the motion of the rope cutting through the air at different speeds.
 
It establishes a relationship with the public, who begin to discover that their movements have an influence on the space and its sounds, alternating states of great agitation with others when they stop to see how the wave disappears in space like a whistle in the wind.
 
Over the years different custom installations have been commissioned along with an interface to be able to manipulate the Waves, either by me or the staff for a more performance type of show like in the Soho House Istambul, or directly by the audience like on the Science Museums of London and Barcelona; while the original edition (motion tracking) is reserved for Art Museums, collectors and exhibitions.

I've been using Paint.Net for longer than I can remember (started with XP) and love it, and donate. Just got a new Lenovo running WIndows 11, though my whole family pressed me to get an Apple, just so I could continue with Paint.net. Took the thing out of its damned S Mode, installed Chrome, and first thing after installing Chrome and ensuring I have Gmail and Google Drive, I tried to download Paint.net. But it seems impossible to do without changing my default web browser to Wave. I don't want that. All I want is Paint.net, not to mess with anything else. Please.
 
Thank you Bolt Bait. Please note that both the **getpaint.net**and the **dotpdn.com**site seem to be overrun with fake "**Start**" and "**Start Download**" link images that would download the Wave browser from WaveSor Software - a malicious program (check the conversation about this on Reddit - \_browser\_by\_wavesor\_software/.)
 
There are three different "**Start"**link boxes that download the Wave browser on getpaint.net, and at least one "**Start**" link box on dotpdn.com. They're like ads, but disguised to make site users think they're downloading paint.net - "Wave browser" is mentioned only in much smaller print at the bottom.
 
OK wait a minute. I held up on sending this message for a while while I downloaded PicPick, because I wanted to include an image of the site page (attached) so you can see exactly what I
