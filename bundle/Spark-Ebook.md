So, is there a publishing life beyond Amazon Kindle? The answer is a definite yes, from my perspective. Moreover, authors play an important role in keeping our publishing system healthy by succeeding with a diversity of suppliers.
 
The big new decision with Ingram, of course, was whether to move my four earlier books from their Lightning Source world over to the newer IngramSpark realm. Then I would place the new book also in Spark. After studying this, it appeared to me that a change was appropriate. So I requested it.

Some of my data, which I thought I had in LSI and in CreateSpace, did not seem to come through completely in the new systems. Look carefully over any earlier books with LSI to see if your data is present or missing in Spark.
 
Ingram did raise a fuss about the photo profiles and the dpi (dots-per-inch) of the photos in the PDF upload for print. My book is a travel guide and has some color photos presented as black and white photos. Color photos still seem to me too costly to manufacture as color in print-on-demand books.
 
So I have my color photos set to show as black and white photos. I realize they will look OK, but not pretty. Ingram made me sign off on the color profiles in the book upload as suitable for my black and white photos in the book. I signed off. The photos came out OK black and white. I am not convinced that changing the color profile would have improved their appearance. However, I am teachable, so will keep watching over this matter.
 
Both Kindle and Ingram are major printing systems with a credible ability to deliver serviceable books to you. Both are also necessary for your success. Working directly with Kindle for its immediate print-book customer audience is a wise approach.
 
Working with Ingram is necessary for bookstores, which will not order from Kindle. Amazon Kindle will not allow bookstores to return un-sold books, something the trade has accepted for a long time. It is not easy to make a profit in the retail bookstore market.
 
The charge for most-economical shipping was about the same, $5.95 Kindle and $6 Ingram. But there were some differences. Kindle gave me a defined delivery date and a trackable courier bar code number. Ingram shipped by USPS Media Mail and could not provide a definitive delivery date. Ingram alerted me that I was responsible if the books got lost in the USPS Mail.
 
The books arrived from both systems in about nine days. However, I must say that the Ingram purchase was a little more stressful because there was no tracking and lost books would be my problem. Both batches of printed books looked reasonably good.
 
I was pleased that I had learned to navigate the new and evolving systems of these major book/ebook sellers. I can now go in and tweak metadata about my earlier books with ease since I learned new details.
 
Of course, this was all just the first step. My ongoing promotion of my new book and all my books in social media and on my website will need to proceed simultaneously. However, I paused for a moment, to rest, before pushing forward in the quest.

Books, videos, and other materials in library catalogs are assigned official subject headings by the Library of Congress (LCSH) by cataloging librarians. These subject headings describe an item's content and what it is about, and are useful for focusing research on broader, narrower, or related topics. Look for subject heading links in the library catalog to find more items on the same topic. Some subject headings are dated or even problematic, and they can be changed through a petition process.
 
For example, the book Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex, and Stardom has LC subject headings to describe it like "Hispanic Americans in motion pictures" and "Race in motion pictures," but (as of 2022), "Latina" is not an official LCSH and "Latinos" is listed as a variant.
 
If you know the subject headings that are likely to be tagged on the item you want to find, search by Subject. **California -- Merced County** is an example of a Geographical Subject Heading.
 
Subdivisions, or subheadings, are words or phrases which may be added to a subject heading to create a more effective se
