I also wanted to create OPEN SSL for Windows 10. An easy way to do it without running into a risk of installing unknown software from 3rd party websites and risking entries of viruses, is by using the openssl.exe that comes inside your Git for Windows installation. In my case, I found the open SSL in the following location of Git for Windows Installation.
 
If you also want instructions on how to use OPENSSL to generate and use Certificates, here is a write-up on my blog. The step by step instructions first explains how to use Microsoft Windows Default Tool and also OPEN SSL and explains the difference between them.
 
The point is that many who've implemented WSL may not realize they can call upon ANY linux command (within their underlying WSL linux vm) right from the DOS or powershell command-line this way. (It's easy to fall into thinking the point of WSL is to use it to "shell into the vm", which is indeed an option, but the power to just run linux commands from Windows is a real value-add of WSL.)
 
And to be clear, in doing the command as above, whatever file names or folders you may point to (or create) will be relative to the **Windows** folder from which you run the command. So doing for example, openssl req to create a self-signed cert, where you may name -keyout selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt, those two files will be created in the **Windows** folder where you ran the command.
 
That said, there are ways this could fall down for some openssl command examples one may find, such as if they tried to use various bash-specific arguments, in which case "shelling into wsl" to run the command may well be the better choice. You could still direct things to be found or placed on the host, but I don't mean this answer to become overly-focused on such WSL aspects. I just wanted to propose it as another alternative to installing openssl.

I recently needed to document how to get a version of it installed, so I've copied my steps here, as the other answers were using different sources from what I recommend, which is Cygwin. I like Cygwin because it is well maintained and provides a wealth of other utilities for Windows. Cygwin also allows you to easily update the versions as needed when vulnerabilities are fixed. Please update your version of OpenSSL often!
 
I installed openssl 3.0.0 from then I go to windows start ->openssl->Win64 OpenSSL Command Prompt, it opens a window like regular dos window, all I need is to go to the installation folder of openssl.
 
Good afternoon, so I'm trying to install prestashop for the first time on a local machine with xamp so I can run some tests and learn more about the platform, but I came across this error and I can't move forward, I've seen some posts here on the forum and even so for a person who doesn't know anything about it, I couldn't get away with it. I have also tried to create a certificate manually to see if it is resolved, but without success. If anyone has any tips to help in a simple way.
 
Press Windows + R to open the Windows Run prompt. Type in sysdm.cpl and click OK. Open the Advanced tab and click on the Environment Variables button in the System Properties window.
Add variable name: "OPENSSL\_CONF" variable value like: "C:\xampp\apache\conf\openssl.cnf" with the path where you installed xampp. Note that after setting an environment variable you need to restart Windows for it to work.
 
-CApath directoryThe directory to use for server certificate verification. This directory must be in "hash format", see verify for more information. These are also used when building the client certificate chain.
 
This site has a list of various sites that provide PEM bundles, and refers to this git hub project, which provides copies of all the main OS PEM bundles in single file format which can be used by OpenSSL on windows.
 
You can download them from the internet, or if you run Certificate Manager you can grab them from your own computer. **Win+R > certmgr** opens the program, and then **Certificates - Local Computer > Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates** opens the list. From there select the appropriate Certificate Authority (as an example, if you're authenticating against LetsEncrypt / Certbot, the CA in 2021 is "ISRG Root X1"). **Right Click > All Tasks > Export** brings up the Export Wizard, and "Base-64 encoded X.509" will get you a pem file you can save out.
 
If you only need to check against a single CA, you're now basically done. Run openssl.exe with the option -CAfile x:/path/to/your/new/file.cer and you as long as your file is the correct Root CA you shouldn't get that error.
 
But what you asked about was -CApath which allows you to have multiple CA files and it will check against whichever is appropriate. Using this method on Windows has one extra step. The documentation for s\_client says the directory you point to must be in "hash format" and to check the documentation for verify which says files must be named in the format "hash.0" as described in the documentation for x509 which gives us our answer: the directory pointed to by -CApath can't just have files with any old names, they must be named based on their encrypted "Certificate Subject Names" which you can get from openssl.exe x509
 
I have been able to successfully build openssl 1.1.1.9 in windows 10 following the instructions in the release. I am using Microsoft visual studio 2019 + strawberry perl + nasm. I ran the following config command using the x64 native tools command prompt for vs 2019:
 
I was once able to do this following the above steps for an older version of python. That version shipped with openssl 1.1.3 (could be 4) and I built the dlls for 1.1.6 (could be 7) and replaced them and python had no issues. Is it possible that the default configuration scripts have changed over these versions such that the default windows x64 configuration no longer builds openssl in a way that works with python and I therefore need to use custom settings?
 
However, you may need to patch one file in OpenSSL, which will be the bit that looks for its current executable to load the function table (either in uplink.c or applink.c, I forget right now). In CPython, this table is in \_ssl.pyd, so we have a little patch that looks there as well. cpython/openssl.vcxproj at 1e5d33e9b9b8631b36f061103a30208b206fd03a python/cpython GitHub
 
As long as you do not use any fancy config options, you can just swap out libcrypto and libssl with a newer version. OpenSSL patch releases are ABI backwards compatible. Some options affect ABI, e.g. OpenSSL builds without TLS 1.0.
 
It would be great if you could automatically update the underlying openssl version using a pip command or something similar. That would decouple the act of updating openssl from updating the python version itself. openssl security updates can then be delivered as soon as they are available without needing to wait until a new python release, and users can update openssl without being forced to update their python version.
 
what we did till now for python is , got the source code of 3.9.2 and built it on Vs 2017 and generated all pyd, dlls etc. Next step we thought we need to link it to openssl 1.0.2 by replacing the include dir and libs in vcproj of \_ssl.vcproj and rebuild again
 
Hi all,
I'm still new to Rust, hence my question. I'm lost in the dark and don't see any light in any direction (despite spinning in circles) and am hoping I can get some assistance... PLEEEEEASE .
 
I have a project that is developed on Windows and compiled for Windows and also cross compiled for aarch64. The project has a lot of functionality already implemented and now I wish to do a HTTP call. I've looked into a few HTTP crates and have chosen to use reqwest. So I added the reqwest crate to my Cargo.toml file and did a small experimental code and it builds fine and runs fine on Windows. I then tried to cross compile the project and the build failed.
 
Upon further reading of the reqwest crate documentation it says that the **Requirements** for Windows and MacOS are "nothing" and for Linux you need openssl. So I added the openssl crate to the Cargo.toml and when I tried to build I got the following output:
 
So I googled around to try and find some guidance or solutions to these build errors. I came across this post which points to this thread. Reading through all of this I tried to add the "vendored" feature as described in this post. When trying to build this I got the error output of:
 
Then further reading of the openssl crate documentation openssl it says that I need perl installed. So I've fumbled my way through and figured out how to install perl and then try to build again. This time the error output is like this:
 
I've been researching how to get this cross compile to work for a fair while now, can anyone tell me:
Am I even on the right track any more?
Is this right, I need perl to be able to compile the openssl crate?
Could anyone point me to some documentation or guide or other that might assist me?
 
I came across the same issue. From what I gather, OpenSSL can't find a required configuration file. Luckily when installing Splunk the necessary file is placed in "c:\Program Files\Splunk\openssl.cnf". Unfortunately, installing Splunk does not s
