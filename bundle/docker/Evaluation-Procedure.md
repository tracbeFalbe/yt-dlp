We apply it to almost all funding schemes. Its rules are based on the principles and criteria of the SNSF and on the DORA Declaration. All researchers and their ideas have equal chances of success in the process. Those whose projects and performance are most convincing from a scientific point of view will receive funding.
 
To avoid conflicts of interest, our guidelines on bias and recusal apply to everyone involved in the evaluation process. And, of course, we expect you as a researcher to follow good scientific practice.

All reviewers and the members of the responsible evaluation panel rate your proposal according to a standardised scale from 1 to 9. Grade 1 on the scale means that the project has few or no strengths, but many serious weaknesses. Grade 9, on the other hand, means that the project is convincing in all aspects and has no or only negligible weaknesses.
 
The standardised numerical scale provides clarity and comparability. In addition, it allows the evaluators to apply a statistical procedure to establish a final ranking of the proposals based on the ratings.
 
For some funding schemes, additional steps are included. For instance, you may have to submit a project outline or pre-proposal before you submit the full proposal. Or you may have to present your project in person. Information on these processes can be found on the pages of the individual funding schemes.
 
Once the Administrative Offices have verified the requirements, they will forward your proposal to the appropriate evaluation panel of the Research Council. Some funding schemes have several panels. In such cases, the scientific discipline in question determines who will evaluate it.
 
Please note: until the proposal is submitted, the Administrative Offices will be happy to answer your questions. If necessary, we may ask you to provide additional information during the verification phase so as to prevent any delay in the process. After the verification phase and through to the communication of results, we cannot provide you with any additional information.

The administrative check is followed by the scientific examination. For most funding schemes, at least two external reviewers assess your proposal first. How do we choose them? The Administrative Offices and the evaluation panel look for researchers who are at the cutting edge of international research in their field. They must be independent of the SNSF and have no ties with you. That is why most of the reviewers are based abroad.
 
Are there certain people you don't want us to ask for an expert review? You can mention them by name when submitting the proposal. We will take your request into account as long as you can provide objective reasons.
 
The reviewers will assess your proposal independently of each other and will each prepare a review based on the criteria defined by the SNSF. These include, for example, the scientific relevance of your project and its originality or your expertise and scientific track record. For each criterion, the evaluators provide a rating on the nine-point scale. Then they evaluate the entire proposal and summarise the main reasons for their assessment. The reviewers are aware that you can read the review in anonymised form once the procedure is concluded.
 
Now at least two members of the responsible evaluation panel will review your proposal as referees. The Administrative Offices assign it to them based on the scientific discipline as well as the keywords and a short description.
 
All members of the evaluation panels work on an honorary basis and are elected by the Research Council because of their expertise and research experience. On the panel, they represent the SNSF rather than their own institution.
 
First, the referees assess the usefulness of the external reviews. Are they coherent and comprehensible? Are the assessments clear and properly substantiated? The referees then give their own rating for each evaluation criterion on the basis of the reviews. In most funding schemes, they also examine whether the requested budget is appropriate.
 
Finally, the referees rate your proposal as a whole according to the nine-point scale and recommend this rating to the evaluation panel. In their written and independent recommendations, they list the main strengths and weaknesses with regard to each criterion. We will inform you of these in broad terms in the event of a rejection.
 
For some funding schemes, your project will first be reviewed internally, either in the form of a pre-proposal or a full proposal. Based on the referees' assessments, the evaluation panel will make an initial decision. If your project is selected, it will go through the evaluation process from external review to the communication of results.
 
The external and internal assessments provide a uniform basis for decision-making for each proposal. All members of the evaluation panel are provided with the proposal, information about the applicants, the external reviews, the recommendations of the referees and the budget. This allows for a structured, informed and fair discussion. Some funding schemes require an interview or a presentation as a broader basis for decision-making.
 
During the meeting of the evaluation panel, the referees present the proposals assigned to them and justify their recommendations. Subsequently, the panel members discuss the proposal in terms of the identified strengths and weaknesses and based on the SNSF criteria. The external reviews play an important role in this discussion, but the panel may not always share the reviewer's opinion.
 
Each member then rates the proposal electronically on the nine-point scale. Only after everyone has voted are the individual ratings displayed. This ensures an independent vote based both on the recommendations of the referees and the discussion.
 
The members of the evaluation panel have evaluated each proposal. This now makes it possible to create a ranked list. However, a classification based solely on average ratings is problematic. Perhaps some members did not vote on all proposals because of conflicts of interest. Or some are reluctant to give high marks, while others judge less harshly. Therefore, the SNSF applies a procedure based on the Bayesian Ranking. This statistical model takes into account random fluctuations and other uncertain factors. In this process, each proposal is compared with every other proposal to create the final ranking.
 
Based on this ranking and the available funding, the responsible body of the Research Council determines a cut-off point for funding ("funding line"). If your proposal is above the funding line, it will be funded; but if it is below, you will unfortunately not receive any funding.
 
The funding line might run through a group of proposals that are of exactly the same scientific quality. The responsible body of the Research Council may then make a random selection by drawing lots; the proposals that are drawn will be funded. Alternatively, the SNSF may refrain from funding the entire group.
 
The panel's provisional funding decisions are submitted to the Presiding Board of the Research Council. It checks whether the evaluation has been conducted correctly and whether the budget and framework conditions have been adhered to. If this is the case, the Presiding Board approves the decisions, which are then final.
 
After the final decision, the Administrative Offices will inform you about the result as soon as possible. You will receive a reasoned written decision, in accordance with the Federal Act on Administrative Procedure. Generally, you will also learn in which quintile your proposal was classified. The top 20 per cent of proposals are in the first quintile.
 
Do you disagree with the rejection because you believe mistakes were made in the evaluation process? Then you can either request that the SNSF reconsider its decision or lodge an appeal with the Federal Administrative Court.
 
Justified reconsideration requests are assessed by the Administrative Offices. If there are no indications that the decision was flawed, the request will not be followed up. However, if there are any indications to the contrary, the reconsideration request will be discussed by the Research Council. The Council will then either reject the request or make a new material decision.
 
If you do not accept the decision, you will need to lodge your appeal with the Federal Administrative Court within 30 days of receiving the SNSF's ruling. Instead of stating its case before the court, the SNSF may reconsider its decision and issue a new ruling. As a matter of course, we recommend that you contact the Administrative Offices for information about the appeal procedure. The 30-day period will remain unaffected.
 
This edition of the GESAMP Hazard Evaluation Procedure provides an updated set of criteria for evaluating the hazards of chemicals (substances and mixtures) that may enter the marine environment through operational discharge, accidental spillage, or loss overboard from ships.
 
Its purpose is not to replace the revised GESAMP hazard evaluation procedure, but to update it with as little disruption to the user as possible, only introducing changes where necessary, in particular to ensure harmonization with IMO regulations and the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS).
 
The most important considerations during the planning phase of your project evaluation are prioritizing short and long-term goals, identifying your target audience(s), determining methods for collecting data, and assessing t
