Contrary to what many people think, watches from car brands are very affordable in many cases. There are many car brands that have their own watch line with their logo on the watch and there are even car brands that collaborate with watch brands and release an exclusive watch line. Luxury and exclusivity is often the link between cars and watches.
 
Today, the watch industry and car brands are inextricably linked. Certain car brands are now almost obliged to bring luxury lifestyle products to the market. In particular, the more exclusive car brands such as Rolls Royce, Bentley, Maserati and Ferrari have their own watch line. A watch line or other lifestyle products also help a car brand identify their brand.

You can endlessly discuss the prices of watches. What someone finds expensive, the other finds fine to pay and while some people find an expensive watch a waste of money, the other sees this as a beautiful possession and a good investment.
 
Whatever your opinion of car watches is; prices can vary widely. But why are these price differences between watches from car brands so large? The most important aspect in determining the price of a branded car watch is supply and demand. If a hundred thousand of one watch are produced and only 50 of the other, and both are in high demand, it goes without saying that one is more expensive than the other. This is also the case with exclusive cars and classics. Scarce models of a well-known and popular brand are becoming increasingly valuable.
 
A branded car watch is generally a product that you thoroughly study before you buy it. People often want to look at and feel the timepiece they have in mind to see if it matches their wishes and expectations. To do this, they visit the jeweler to use the service there as well.
 
Even so, exclusive products such as watches are increasingly ordered online by consumers. This is because it is very accessible and websites that sell watches often do everything they can to give you a good idea of your dream watch online.
 
You can see this, for example, on a website of Ferrari, Porsche or Aston Martin. These car brands have often compiled an extensive photo report of each watch and made videos. They also have an extensive description of the car watch with all information about the timepiece and they provide a warranty and certificates of authenticity.
 
Watches are beautiful accessories that can complete your outfit or even match it with your car. They come in many colours, sizes, brands and types. But how do you check whether the car brand watch you have in mind is genuine or not. Some useful tips to check the authenticity of a watch:

Well-known car brands with watches are brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Range Rover, Maserati, Aston Martin, Porsche and Audi. But there are also watch brands for motorsport enthusiasts. Think for example of the Rolex Daytona, Hublot Techframe Ferrari, Tag Heuer Silverstone or Omega Speedmaster. For real racing enthusiasts, an Autosport watch is often a must-have.
 
Within the range of speedmaster watches from Omega, we find this Racing, with a 40mm case. The Omega Speedmaster Racing was worn on the moon and the north and south poles, among other places. Before that, this watch could already be found on the wrists of the men and women of powerful automobiles. The price of the Omega Speedmaster Racing depends on the production year and version.
 
The Rolex Cosmograph Daytona has been around since the 1960s and is therefore a true classic. The popular luxury watch brand devised this watch specifically for enthusiasts of racing and vintage cars. Countless greats from the car and film industry had the Rolex Cosmograph Daytona on their wrist. Hollywood legend Paul Newman, for example, wore it every day from 1972 until his death in 2008.
 
Singer watches are very special watches. The eye for detail, finish and choice of materials is what makes these timepieces so special. The Singer Track 1 is a chronograph with a lot of functions and like every other watch in this list except the Seiko, it has Swiss mechanics.
 
The Omega speedmaster has been a star in the chronograph market since 1957. The Professional variant came out 6 years later and was an instant style icon. Shortly afterwards, this watch also became the first watch to be worn on the moon. Today, the Omega Speedmaster is the most extensively tested timepiece and is the favorite mechanical classic to start new watch collections.
 
The Breitling Navitimer is especially attractive because of all the different functions. From simple arithmetic operations to converting exchange rates and to calculating fuel consumption and average speed by the tachometer. These features can be attractive to people who travel a lot, such as pilots. After 60 years, the Breitling Navitimer is still easy to recognize. The models with the AOPA logo, as well as those with the Valjoux 72, are highly sought after by collectors.
 
The TAG Heuer Carerra was introduced in 1963. This watch was ahead of the competition at the time and was very popular in motorsport. Before the arrival of the Carrera, only the Omega Speedmaster could be used by these people. Only later did other classics appear on the market, such as the Rolex Daytona and Heuer Monaco. Today, this model can be found in various variations and designs.
 
The Tag Heuer Monaco is a unique and iconic watch that is highly sought after among collectors. The unusual shape of these watches attracts attention. The Tag Heuer Monaco was a step ahead of the Seiko 6139 and Zenith El Primero. The status of these watches is great within the world of watches. This iconic status has been confirmed time and again by filmmakers who give this watch a role in various films. The Tag Heuer Monaco is a watch with character that makes a statement.

Car engineers design and develop cars that do not require their users to acquire car-engineering skills to operate. Otherwise, there would be no car for general public. Car engineers provide **accessible controls** (such as wheels, ignition device etc.) by abstracting away the technological complexities of car engineering in order to provide car controls that are approachable to drivers of the general population.
 
**YES** because In today's software engineering paradigm, software engineers use software development platform and tool to design, develop, build and deploy Apps for their users. Hyperlinks, widgets and forms are accessible controls software engineers make available for their users in the Apps they program.
 
**NO** because In the current software engineering mindset, software development is to produce apps. User-controls are pre-determined by software engineers, leaving users no room to maneuver for themselves over choices of resources or control over interaction sequence and steps. While today's Apps are cool and great, they are also very rigid from users' perspective. Apps do not always perform tasks exactly the way individual users would have done it, had they been given the control. In addition, the exponential growth in number of Apps has becoming unmanageable for end users. We just cannot envision to have one or multiple similar Apps for each and every purpose for every single thing.
 
For the purpose of illustration, let's consider the following scenario. No online retailer today is able to unleash their shoppers to shop on shoppers' personalized conditions and context. What do I mean by that? Suppose shopper Joe wants to buy a smart watch that he has selected for himself from an online retailer as a reward when he reaches his weight-loss goal of losing twenty pounds, as monitored by his Fitbit. He wants to auto buy if the price is less than $400 when his Fitbit tells him his goal is achieved. He also wants to tweet about it and post it on Facebook when that victorious day arrives.
 
What Apps today can do that for Joe? Or for other shopper who shops with his
