The tenth edition of ***Operating System Concepts*** has been revised to keep it fresh and up-to-date with contemporary examples of how operating systems function, as well as enhanced interactive elements to improve learning and the student's experience with the material. It combines instruction on concepts with real-world applications so that students can understand the practical usage of the content. End-of-chapter problems, exercises, review questions, and programming exercises help to further reinforce important concepts. New interactive self-assessment problems are provided throughout the text to help students monitor their level of understanding and progress. A Linux virtual machine (including C and Java source code and development tools) allows students to complete programming exercises that help them engage further with the material.

He held a professorship at the University of Texas at Austin, where he taught until 1993. He became a professor at Yale University in 2005, where he was the chair of the Computer Science department from 2005 to 2011. Prior to coming to Yale in 2003, Silberschatz worked at the Bell Labs.
 
Mainframe operating systems have an acquired dinosaur trope that even their manufacturers recognize.[7]Peter B. Galvin, co-author, notes that the series of books became informally known as the *dinosaur book* due to the illustrations on the front cover[8] depicting the various operating systems as actual dinosaurs.[9][10]
 
Some operating systems do this, like vxWorks. It's just taking the shell itself, and packing it into the kernel. If you can do something in user space (ie: shell as a user space application), you can do it (with some difficulty) in the kernel. The usual caveats apply, such as not being able to link user space libraries into kernel code, etc.
 
It's easy, on Linux for example, to write directly to a PTY from a kernel module. You can just as easily get the stdin for a process by hijacking system calls, among other methods. Now you have your I/O mechanisms, and just need a parser to handle all the internal logic.
 
Open-source operating systems, virtual machines, and clustered computing are among the leading fields of operating systems and networking that are rapidly changing. With substantial revisions and organizational changes, Silberschatz, Galvin, and GagnesOperating System Concepts, Eighth Edition remains as current and relevant as ever, helping you master the fundamental concepts of operating systems while preparing yourself for todays emerging developments.
 
Beyond the basics, the Eight Edition sports substantive revisions and organizational changes that clue you in to such cutting-edge developments as open-source operating systems, multi-core processors, clustered computers, virtual machines, transactional memory, NUMA, Solaris 10 memory management, Suns ZFS file system, and more. New to this edition is the use of a simulator to dynamically demonstrate several operating system topics.
 
Best of all, a greatly enhanced WileyPlus, a multitude of new problems and programming exercises, and other enhancements to this edition all work together to prepare you enter the world of operating systems with confidence.

Professor Silberschatz is an ACM Fellow and an IEEE Fellow. He received the 2002 IEEE Taylor L. Booth Education Award, the 1998 ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award, and the 1997 ACM SIGMOD Contribution Award. In recognition of his outstanding level of innovation and technical excellence, he was awarded the Bell Laboratories President's Award for three different Projects -- the QTM Project (1998), the DataBlitz Project (1999), and the NetInventory Project (2004).
 
Professor Silberschatz' writings have appeared in numerous ACM and IEEE publications and other professional conferences and journals. He is a coauthor of the textbook Database System Concepts. He has also written Op-Ed articles for the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Hartford Courant, among others.
 
Peter Baer Galvin is the chief technologist for Corporate Technologies (www.cptech.com), a computer facility reseller and integrator. Before that, Mr. Galvin was the systems manager for Brown University's Computer Science Department. He is also Sun columnist for ;login: magazine. Mr. Galvin has written articles for Byte and other magazines, and has written columns for SunWorld and SysAdmin magazines. As a consultant and trainer, he has given talks and taught tutorials on security and system administration worldwide.
 
Greg Gagne is chair of the Computer Science department at Westminster College in Salt Lake City where he has been teaching since 1990. In addition to teaching operating systems, he also teaches computer networks, distributed systems, and software engineering. He also provides workshops to computer science educators and industry professionals.
 
I am student from CS background and I have Operating Systems in my upcoming semester. A simple search around the internet revealed that that Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz and Galvin is one of the best ones to follow.
 
Now the above text is probably in its 10th edition currently. Now I won't be able to afford a physical copy of the latest edition, so I was looking around for few cheap used copies and found abundance of 5th edition and few 6th edition texts.
 
Consider the title: Operating System Concepts. It is about basic and fundamental concepts that underlie operating systems. The basic concepts, the core material of the text, are not going to change much from first edition to the tenth.
 
Like desktop applications, complex embedded applications benefit from thesupport of an underlying operating system. However, the requirements of anembedded operating system differ considerably from those of a desktopoperating system.
 
The Pebble operating system provides two features that we see as criticalfor complex embedded applications: (1) safe extensibility, so that thesystem can be constructed from untrusted components and reconfigured whilerunning, and (2) low interrupt latency, which ensures that the system canreact quickly to external events.
 
In this paper we discuss Pebble's architecture and the underlying technologyused by Pebble, and include microbenchmark performance results thatdemonstrate that Pebble is a good platform for complex embeddedapplications.
