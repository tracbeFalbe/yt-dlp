Coforge and its group companies ("NIIT") have realized that various individuals/ entities represent themselves as recruiters for Coforge and are contacting people offering false employment opportunities and are taking personal details and money in the name of Coforge. We take such matters extremely seriously and work with the appropriate legal authorities to check fraudulent activities. We, as a company, believe in avoiding and stopping such practices by making you aware through this notification. Coforge clarifies that no such letter or offer or monies taken, in any circumstance, give rise to any liability towards Coforge.
