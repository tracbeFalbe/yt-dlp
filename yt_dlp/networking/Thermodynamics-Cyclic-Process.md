Conversely, the cycle may be reversed and use work to move heat from a cold source and transfer it to a warm sink thereby acting as a heat pump. If at every point in the cycle the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, the cycle is reversible. Whether carried out reversible or irreversibly, the net entropy change of the system is zero, as entropy is a state function.

During a closed cycle, the system returns to its original thermodynamic state of temperature and pressure. Process quantities (or path quantities), such as heat and work are process dependent. For a cycle for which the system returns to its initial state the first law of thermodynamics applies:
 
The above states that there is no change of the internal energy ( U \displaystyle U ) of the system over the cycle. E i n \displaystyle E\_in represents the total work and heat input during the cycle and E o u t \displaystyle E\_out would be the total work and heat output during the cycle. The repeating nature of the process path allows for continuous operation, making the cycle an important concept in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic cycles are often represented mathematically as quasistatic processes in the modeling of the workings of an actual device.
 
Equation (2) is consistent with the First Law; even though the internal energy changes during the course of the cyclic process, when the cyclic process finishes the system's internal energy is the same as the energy it had when the process began.
 
Thermodynamic power cycles are the basis for the operation of heat engines, which supply most of the world's electric power and run the vast majority of motor vehicles. Power cycles can be organized into two categories: real cycles and ideal cycles. Cycles encountered in real world devices (real cycles) are difficult to analyze because of the presence of complicating effects (friction), and the absence of sufficient time for the establishment of equilibrium conditions. For the purpose of analysis and design, idealized models (ideal cycles) are created; these ideal models allow engineers to study the effects of major parameters that dominate the cycle without having to spend significant time working out intricate details present in the real cycle model.

Power cycles can also be divided according to the type of heat engine they seek to model. The most common cycles used to model internal combustion engines are the Otto cycle, which models gasoline engines, and the Diesel cycle, which models diesel engines. Cycles that model external combustion engines include the Brayton cycle, which models gas turbines, the Rankine cycle, which models steam turbines, the Stirling cycle, which models hot air engines, and the Ericsson cycle, which also models hot air engines.
 
Thermodynamic cycles may be used to model real devices and systems, typically by making a series of assumptions.[2] simplifying assumptions are often necessary to reduce the problem to a more manageable form.[2] For example, as shown in the figure, devices such a gas turbine or jet engine can be modeled as a Brayton cycle. The actual device is made up of a series of stages, each of which is itself modeled as an idealized thermodynamic process. Although each stage which acts on the working fluid is a complex real device, they may be modelled as idealized processes which approximate their real behavior. If energy is added by means other than combustion, then a further assumption is that the exhaust gases would be passed from the exhaust to a heat exchanger that would sink the waste heat to the environment and the working gas would be reused at the inlet stage.
 
The difference between an idealized cycle and actual performance may be significant.[2] For example, the following images illustrate the differences in work output predicted by an ideal Stirling cycle and the actual performance of a Stirling engine:
 
As the net work output for a cycle is represented by the interior of the cycle, there is a significant difference between the predicted work output of the ideal cycle and the actual work output shown by a real engine. It may also be observed that the real individual processes diverge from their idealized counterparts; e.g., isochoric expansion (process 1-2) occurs with some actual volume change.
 
In practice, simple idealized thermodynamic cycles are usually made out of four thermodynamic processes. Any thermodynamic processes may be used. However, when idealized cycles are modeled, often processes where one state variable is kept constant, such as:
 
If the working substance is a perfect gas, U \displaystyle U is only a function of T \displaystyle T for a closed system since its internal pressure vanishes. Therefore, the internal energy changes of a perfect gas undergoing various processes connecting initial state a \displaystyle a to final state b \displaystyle b are always given by the formula
 
Thus, the total heat flow per cycle is calculated without knowing the heat capacities and temperature changes for each step (although this information would be needed to assess the thermodynamic efficiency of the cycle).
 
The Carnot cycle is a cycle composed of the totally reversible processes of isentropic compression and expansion and isothermal heat addition and rejection. The thermal efficiency of a Carnot cycle depends only on the absolute temperatures of the two reservoirs in which heat transfer takes place, and for a power cycle is:
 
The second law of thermodynamics limits the efficiency and COP for all cyclic devices to levels at or below the Carnot efficiency. The Stirling cycle and Ericsson cycle are two other reversible cycles that use regeneration to obtain isothermal heat transfer.
 
A Stirling cycle is like an Otto cycle, except that the adiabats are replaced by isotherms. It is also the same as an Ericsson cycle with the isobaric processes substituted for constant volume processes.
 
Heat flows into the loop through the top isotherm and the left isochore, and some of this heat flows back out through the bottom isotherm and the right isochore, but most of the heat flow is through the pair of isotherms. This makes sense since all the work done by the cycle is done by the pair of isothermal processes, which are described by *Q=W*. This suggests that all the net heat comes in through the top isotherm. In fact, all of the heat which comes in through the left isochore comes out through the right isochore: since the top isotherm is all at the same warmer temperature T H \displaystyle T\_H and the bottom isotherm is all at the same cooler temperature T C \displaystyle T\_C , and since change in energy for an isochore is proportional to change in temperature, then all of the heat coming in through the left isochore is cancelled out exactly by the heat going out the right isochore.
 
Ans. A cyclic process is defined as one in which the initial and final states are the same. It is a series of events that end with the system in the same state as when it began. As a result, in a cyclic transition, the work done by the system equals the heat absorbed by the system.
 
Ans. The cyclic process is defined as when the state of a gas (actual or ideal) changes from one point to another and then returns to the same state. The state change of a gas is represented by changes in state parameters such as pressure, volume, and temperature.
 
Ans. The Joule expansion (also known as free expansion) is a thermodynamic process in which a volume of gas is held in one side of a thermally isolated container (via a minor partition) while the other side is evacuated.
 
Ans. The amount of free energy in a system determines how it changes and how much work it can perform. The Helmholtz free energy F, also known as the work function, and the Gibbs free energy G are two other ways to represent it.
 
A cyclic thermodynamic process is a series of changes in a system that eventually brings the system back to its original state. It is represented by a closed loop on a thermodynamic diagram and involves the exchange of heat and work between the system and its surroundings.
 
The three main types of cyclic thermodynamic processes are the Carnot cycle, the Otto cycle, and the Diesel cycle. The Carnot cycle is a reversible process that operates between two thermal reservoirs, while the Otto and Diesel cycles are internal combustion processes used in engines.
 
The efficiency of a cyclic thermodynamic process is the ratio of the work output to the heat input. It is always less than 100% due to energy losses during the process. The Carnot cycle has the highest possible efficiency for a given temperature difference between the two reservoirs.
 
Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. In a cyclic thermodynamic process, entropy remains constant as the system returns to its initial state. However, the entropy of the surroundings may change due to the exchange of heat and work.
 
Cyclic thermodynamic processes are present in many everyday devices and systems. Examples include the operation of a refrigerator or air conditioner, the combustion process in an engine, and the water cycle in nature. They are also used in industrial processes such as power generation and refrigeration systems.
