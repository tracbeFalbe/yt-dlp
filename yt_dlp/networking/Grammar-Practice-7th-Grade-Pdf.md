This book includes two worksheets per week that can be added to morning work or used as supplements to Latin or literature studies. English Grammar Practice makes an excellent addition to language study at the end of primary school and prepares students for more in-depth work in grammar school.

Please click on a grade level at the bottom of this page and then scroll down to view samples of the **Teacher Guide**, the **DGP Academy Instructional Video Series**, and the **Student Workbook**. Use the drop-down menu to put items in your book bag.
 
Please note that the sentences in our first edition materials for grades 6-12 are shorter and less complex than those in our second edition books, but the grammar skills addressed are the same in both versions.
 
Our grade 4 grammar worksheets focus on the writing of proper sentences and the correction of common problems (sentence fragments, run-on sentences, double negatives, etc). We also review narrative writing, opinion writing and informative writing with exercises and writing prompts.

The Bible version comes in levels 1-6 rather than grade levels. It seems much more homeschool friendly that way. I hadn't seen that version when I looked at it before. Now I'm even more interested. :)
 
We used it for grammar and loved it. I just wouldn't recommend it for upper levels unless you are a grammar expert, because there isn't much in the way of grammar instruction. I think we maxed out around level 7.
 
Not really. If you look at the samples on this page, you will see "help pages" toward the beginning of both the teacher's and student's books. They contain just a brief description of the different parts of speech, parts of the sentence, etc. It's more for reference than instruction.
 
I read in one of the book introductions that she recommends that you still teach grammar in the classroom during writing class and other times. So I think you're right that it was meant to go alongside grammar instruction, not take the place of it exactly.
 
One use I was considering was to use it after a few years of Rod and Staff in order to review the concepts learned. We might do R&S through 6th grade and then go to the Bible version of the DGP for the rest of middle school.
 
I used it in 5th with my oldest. I liked it for a break year from heavier grammar but felt like there wasn't enough instruction or practice to use continuously. After going through R&S 6 this year, we will be going to DGP 8. I think it will be great for quick review during 8th and through hs if needed.
 
Daily Grammar Practice is very thorough and I would say advanced compared to most grammar books I have seen (even than Rod and Staff). It repeats concepts over and over (kind of like Saxon Math) so my children are really retaining it.
 
The teachers manual is not very helpful in how to instruct, although it is complete. I created a interactive notebook (lapbook) with the grammar terms as a reference book since some of my children were having a hard time or just feeling overwhelmed with the daily reference sheets. We still use the daily reference sheets, but if they are having difficulty, I refer to the notebook pages related to the concept. This seems to have helped.
 
I started my 3rd and 5th grader in book 1. This has been okay 5th grade but a little challenging for my 3rd grader. My third grader had completed about half of First Language Lessons. My fifth grader had completed half of Rod and Staff grammar grade 4.
 
Of note, the author is very helpful. I emailed her and she suggested starting in the 7th book for the 8th and 10th and I think the 3rd book for the 3rd and 5th graders, since I wanted to keep them together. I wanted to start with book 5 for the olders since I felt they needed the added practice with diagramming and it contained the lines for the sentence already diagrammed in the student book. I am glad I started them where I did since we all had a lot to learn. It has been easy baby steps and very doable.
 
I do think the price is a little bit high. However, I am planning on continuing to use it. The student books are not necessary if you work on a white board, but I like having my kids have their own books.
 
Of note, my 10th grade son took a practice ACT test last summer. There were many terms on it that are in even the 5th and 6th grade books. He has a better understanding of clauses, etc., because of doing this program. If he does not get all the way through the program, I am not worried because it is very deep and thorough.
 
Hey, I am new o your site and I am so thankful for it!! I am working with some of the learning disabled students in the 6th grade. They are not doing well on the selection test. I would love to see the study guides for the selection test if I could. I have tried everything.
 
There are 2 different study guides that I have created. One just has the spelling words, english concepts, reading strategies/skills. The other one actually has the test questions and answer choices for them to fill out each week. Neither one is completely finished for the whole year-still working on them. But, do you want me to share both? Just let me know. I would love to see what you are talking about for the parents!
 
My quiz will simply be 1 sentence that follows the pattern that we have been using that week. So, if our practice sentence for the week was: We are going to the movies, then our quiz sentence would possibly be: They are walking in the woods. Does that make sentence? I will just make up a quiz sentence each week to go with the sheet of sentences that is on my Daily Grammar Practice page. Hope that helps and sorry it took me so long to get back with you! ?
 
Thanks, Christy! I actually changed it a little when school started and do a different sentence each day. Each day we label the parts of speech, subject/predicate, prepositional phrases, types of sentences, kind of sentences. So we still cover almost everything, but we do it each day. I LOVE IT!!!!! About 4 weeks ago I also had them start writing a paragraph story from the sentence of the day. We put it on the ELMO, read it, and critique it-voluntary basis only!! I have them work in groups to critique and compliment. I think they like it, too! ?
 
I LOVE you study guides but we use the Mcgraw McMillan Treasures series so I just used you Template and make study guides for each unit. 36 units later I am excited to use them. Thanks for the great idea
 
I teach 6th grade reading/language arts, and we currently use the Scott Foresman Reading Street series. Teaching is my passion!!! I am hoping to create lots of resources that can be used to supplement this reading series. Please be patient.
 
Learning to use capital letters is a crucial grammar skill for younger students. Splat, a capitalization game created by Lauren Piper, a teacher in Illinois and a Teach Starter collaborator, is a perfect writing small group or writing center activity to get kids thinking about those uppercase and lowercase letters and where they go!
 
Love Scattergories but not quite sure how to translate it to your classroom? Try this grammar activity! Assign students a specific letter of the alphabet, and tell them they have to come up with a common noun, proper noun, and collective noun that begins with that letter.
 
When it comes to learning about how to write compound sentences, sometimes a simple idea can be the thing that makes the lightbulb go on in their little heads. We love this kinesthetic grammar activity for fourth graders as a hands-on way to learn about the function of conjunctions.
 
1. Roll the die. Match the number rolled with the corresponding row on the Roll and Write chart.  
2. Write a simple sentence about the topic you land on.  
3. Continue the process by rolling the die, then writing the correct type of sentence for each roll about the topics you land on.  
4. Read the six sentences as a completed, crazy paragraph!
 
Daily Grammar Practice courses for grades one through twelve present a method for teaching grammar that always teaches the elements of grammar and usage in context and requires only a little time each day. It would be best to use this series over a number of years since it builds gradually from level to level.
 
At younger levels, teachers or parents need to work more closely with children than at upper levels. At all levels, some teaching is required since teaching points are only in the teacher guides. However, students should gradually be able to complete more and more of their work independently.
 
The authors recommend that those who are weak on grammar study the Help Pages before teaching a course. The authors also recommend that the parent or teacher also practice completing the exercises with the student sentences before trying to teach to make sure that they understand each lesson and can explain to students if necessary. DGP requires more from the teacher than do some grammar courses because instructions for teaching new material are not detailed.
