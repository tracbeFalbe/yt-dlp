Mobile Tracker Free is a mobile phone monitoring software that allows you to know in details what is happening on an Android mobile phone. This application is simple to use, includes a whole range of features and all of this for free.
 
Is there any update on having the time track available on the mobile app? Some techs use the mobile app 80% of the time, and not having this on the mobile app prevents us from increasing our Asana adoption rate.

The CONNEX tags are powered by the Shot Scope app and work with your mobile phone in the same way you use your device for contactless. Set up is simple and easy, the powerful 16 lightweight tags easily screw into the end of each club grip.Open up the app on the 1st tee, select your course and you are ready to play!
 
Tracking with CONNEX will give you the precise distances you hit your clubs with Performance Averages. P-Avg tracks the distances you hit shots and removes any outliers that are exceptionally long or short to give you a distance that you can confidently expect to hit your clubs. This then allows you to see any potential gaps in the bag and reconsider your set make-up as well as making it easier to select the right club for the shot club yourself appropriately.
 
Post round, review your game on the Shot Scope app. Identify the exact holes that you are playing well as well as those that you need to improve on. Analyze the shots that are negatively or positively impacting scoring via the shots plotted feature on course analysis. From there, devise a strategy to try and lower your score shot by shot.
 
Performance tracking allows you to see what your tee shot tendencies are and adjust accordingly. It is unlikely that you will hit every fairway, but if you know where you are likely to miss, you can setup for this on the tee box. Keep destructive tee shots off the card and minimise unnecessary penalties off the tee.

Any shot attempting to hit the green beyond 50 yards is classified as an approach. Sliders on the Shot Scope app allow you to narrow this field and look at key yardages. Improve you GIR% and lower scores will soon follow.
 
Post round, review your putting prowess with the interactive graph. A percentage breakdown is given for your putting tendencies, how often do you miss short or long? Shot Scope can tell you this as well as your make % from varying distances, going up in 3ft increments. See how your putting compares to your fellow golfers.
 
Not only can you track your shots to gain the highly valuable performance data, but you can also record your score on a digital scorecard. Convenient, as well as allowing golfers to compare their scoring round to round, season to season, for comparison and goal setting. Is your practice paying off? The only way to know is to track.
 
Unlike traditional statistics, Strokes Gained gives a positive or negative score for each aspect of your game against a defined benchmark. This highly valuable information is available at no additional cost and can show the exact areas of your game that are negatively impacting scoring. Similarly, you can apply this to individual strokes on the mobile app or web dashboard and see if your strategy is helping or hindering your score.
 
CONNEX performance tracking tags record every shot you hit on the golf course, allowing you to keep your score and collect personalized data as you play. Track your game by simply tapping the club tag against your phone (usually kept in a pocket) before each shot.
 
Post round, analyze statistics on how you performed reviewing data on club distances, approaches, short game, putting, shot dispersion and more. Know your strengths and weaknesses with Strokes Gained as well as Handicap Benchmarking so you know what areas to practice on.
 
CONNEX can be used in harmony with other manufacturers, for example if you own or use an alternative GPS product for your distances you can still use CONNEX to track your data. All you require is access to your mobile phone to allow for data tracking.
 
CONNEX works by utilising performance tracking tags and GPS location to give precise distance measurements and shot recording data. Simply screw the tags into the grip of your club and armed with your smartphone, head out onto the course.
 
As with all Shot Scope products, there are no additional fees to access any of the performance tracking data. Purchasing CONNEX grants you access to all statistics, including features such as Strokes Gained and Handicap Benchmarking with no extra subscription fee.
 
We introduce LTrack, a new tracking attack on LTE that allows an attacker to stealthily extract user devices' locations and permanent identifiers (IMSI). To remain stealthy, the localization of devices in LTrack is fully passive, relying on our new uplink/downlink sniffer. Our sniffer records both the times of arrival of LTE messages and the contents of the Timing Advance Commands, based on which LTrack calculates locations. LTrack is the first to show the feasibility of a passive localization in LTE through implementation on software-defined radio.
 
Passive localization attacks reveal a user's location traces but can at best link these traces to a device's pseudonymous temporary identifier (TMSI), making tracking in dense areas or over a long time-period challenging. LTrack overcomes this challenge by introducing and implementing a new type of IMSI Catcher named IMSI Extractor. It extracts a device's IMSI and binds it to its current TMSI. Instead of relying on fake base stations like existing IMSI Catchers, which are detectable due to their continuous transmission, IMSI Extractor relies on our uplink/downlink sniffer enhanced with surgical message overshadowing. This makes our IMSI Extractor the stealthiest IMSI Catcher to date.
 
We evaluate LTrack through a series of experiments and show that in line-of-sight conditions, the attacker can estimate the location of a phone with less than 6m error in 90% of the cases. We successfully tested our IMSI Extractor against a set of 17 modern smartphones connected to our industry-grade LTE testbed. We further validated our uplink/downlink sniffer and IMSI Extractor in a test facility of an operator.

If you are creating a mobile app that will work sending data back and forth from the cloud (I guess that 99% of the apps fall into this use case), you will have at some point the need to sync data between the app and the cloud itself.
 
Synchronizing changes done on the app while it was offline is the easiest part. Figuring out what data has been created, changed or deleted in the application while it was offline is quite easy. Those changes are done directly from the application, so it has knowledge of them. You just need to make sure you keep track of those changes, for example put them in a queue, so that they can be sent to the cloud as soon the connectivity is back.
 
There is nothing new here, as the concept of Connection Resiliency should be quite familiar to all mobile developers. On a mobile device, you never know if connectivity will be available or the endpoint you need to call will there to answer your requests. So you need to code defensively, making sure retry logic and requests queuing is something your application implements correctly. As I'm more experienced with C#, I'm aware of frameworks like Polly and resources like the following:
 
I'm pretty sure there are many resources around this topic, for all the major mobile platform and languages. I'm definitely not a Mobile developer, so if you have any comments or resource to share, please do :).
 
Sending data from the cloud to the app is way more tricky. You want to do it in the most efficient way, to spare bandwidth and device battery life, so you need a way to know what has changed since the last time that specific user and device synced. As data is surely stored in a database of some sort, you also need some efficient method on the database side to make sure you can quickly get everything that is new or changed and that is in the scope for that specific user/device. If your mobile application is successful, this means that you may literally have millions and millions of rows or documents to scan and check for changes.
 
Modern databases can help a lot in tackling this challenge. Azure SQL, for example, has a feature called **Change Tracking** that, guess what?, will take care of keeping track of changes for you.
 
But let's dive into it a bit deeper, to see how it can help us creating a nice API that, when called, will return all the data that has been inserted, updated or deleted since the last time it such API was called from a user/device.
 
The JSON document has two sections. The Metadata section will tell you if you are receiving the Full set of data or just the change set, and an identifier of the version of data you are receiving. In the above sample, we are receiving a Full set, that comes with the version number
