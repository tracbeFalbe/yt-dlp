-Uninstall the NVIDIA driver with DDU and reinstall other drivers.
-Install/Uninstall chipset drivers
-Place OpenGL in the same directory as Blender.exe
-Install another version of Blender.
-Disable HAGS
-Disable rBAR
-Clean install OS.
 
Checking the task manager, it appears that there is plenty of capacity.
I have tested various stable drivers, including the 400s driver that originally included with the GPU, and the error still occurred.

I have not overclocked or changed the frequency of the RAM. I have also had the RAM checked at the link below and it seems to be fine:

I have a system with an AMD GPU which I use for rendering the desktop. I also have a nvidia card which I want to use for developing stuff in CUDA. If I try to install cuda through pacman, it install opengl libraries and override my desktop become unusable, as my monitors are connected to the AMD gpu. I have tried to install nvidia driver using the nvidia installer with the --no-opengl-libs option, but it fails to build the kernel module. Is there anyway I can install the nvidia driver from the package manager without installing opengl libraries?
 
With my desktop being useless I mean that it doesnt even shows the login window. I can just go to a terminal and remove nvidia driver to get a login screen again (after reboot). I am using plasma, sddm with X. I am pretty sure I am using arch linux :-)
 
Typically, a service which depends on packages will have a option where you can specify what that package should be. For example, the fontconfig NixOS module has the option fonts.fonts which can be set to a list of font packages. This allows the fontconfig module to set up the fonts correctly. A similar strategy can be used with a Wayland module, whenever that is written.
 
As mentioned, installing stuff (like mesa) won't change some system properties. In this particular case, the necessary /run/opengl-driver\* symlinks are set up on NixOS when starting the display-manager service.
 
The original Vulkan website was designed for the launch of a cutting edge new API that would, initially, have limited official materials and community content. The old website performed that role admirably, but Vulkan has come a long way and we now have a large and increasing amount of tools, libraries, educational material, and news to showcase that a single page website cannot handle. The new website allows us to gather all these currently disparate internal and community resources in a single, easily navigable place.

Our primary goal with the new vulkan.org site was to place key resources prominently to allow developers to quickly and easily find what they need. With this in mind, each page has buttons in the banner leading straight to the most essential and popular resources. If you need the Vulkan Specification, SDK or Guide you can just jump straight there, no digging needed.
 
In these days of social distancing, game developers and content creators all over the world are working from home and asking for help using Windows Remote Desktop streaming with the OpenGL tools they use. NVIDIA has created a special tool for GeForce GPUs to accelerate Windows Remote Desktop streaming with GeForce drivers R440 or later. Download and run the executable (nvidiaopenglrdp.exe) from the DesignWorks website as Administrator on the remote Windows PC where your OpenGL application will run. A dialog will confirm that OpenGL acceleration is enabled for Remote Desktop and if a reboot is required.
 
After missing their original target of transitioning to Intel Gallium3D by default for Mesa 19.3 as the preferred OpenGL Linux driver on Intel graphics hardware, this milestone has now been reached for Mesa 20.0.
 
The Khronos Group announces the release of the Vulkan 1.2 specification for GPU acceleration. This release integrates 23 proven extensions into the core Vulkan API, bringing significant developer-requested access to new hardware functionality, improved application performance, and enhanced API usability. Multiple GPU vendors have certified conformant implementations, and significant open source tooling is expected during January 2020. Vulkan continues to evolve by listening to developer needs, shipping new functionality as extensions, and then consolidating extensions that receive positive developer feedback into a unified core API specification. Khronos and the Vulkan community will support Vulkan 1.2 in a wide range of open source compilers, tools, and debuggers by the end of January 2020. Driver release updates will be posted on the Vulkan Public Release Tracker.
 
NVIDIA Nsight Systems 2019.6 is now available for download. This release expands graphics trace on Windows by adding support for Direct3D 11, WDDM CPU+GPU queues, and OpenGL. On Linux, new features include support for CUDA 10.2, simultaneous CLI sessions, DWARF unwind and capture by hotkey.
 
Is windows less capable than other Operating Systems??? Does intel recommend us to switch to other operating systems like linux for the best performance of intel hd 3000??? This is ridiculous that we have to switch to other operating systems in order to be able to have openGL 3.3 and OpenCL 1.2 (CPU load only) support. Intel you are responsible for this outcome. Please sort this mess out.
 
Here is the proof that intel hd 3000 is OpenGL3.3 certified. I am waiting for a confirmation for a driver update to support at least openGL 3.3 in windows 7,8, 8.1 too (since intel does not offer a windows 10 driver I will not mention it).
 
have just wasted about 3 hours of sleep to figure out why Bullet demos refused to run and kept crashing with null pointer errors. well thanks to a feature of 3.2 which of course we don't have in 3.1 -> glFramebufferTexture
 
and why 3.3 is totally missing on Windows while present on Linux well this is just preposterous and goes to show that (software) project management can be sloppy even at giant companies. hmmm, or is it there where this was invented in the first place? and then the whole denial thing, "hardware doesn't support it, go away!"... oh man, pure comedy.
 
to tell you the truth I don't really expect Intel to consume time updating the HD 3000 Windows driver to support OpenGL 3.3 which should have been there to begin with. I was hoping to spare about 100 euro on a video card but it seems it is unavoidable, so thank you Intel!
 
regarding the CUDA, what I meant (while writing it wrong of course) was whether the HD 3000 offered any CUDA-like functionality. I suppose OpenCL should be somewhat supported but if that's like the OpenGL 3.3... I know now what to expect. and the purpose is purely computational.
 
this info I tried to find out on the Internet but I couldn't -> how many GPU cores are there on the HD 3000? the developing CUDA competition is stating this number right along all the other graphics card data. if I'm not mistaken this same competition was the first company on the market to offer such a revolutionary feature so if Intel is to at least catch up you'd better be doing quantum leaps on the subject.
 
1. How to upgrade graphics card on a laptop that is integrated on the CPU??? You simply cannot. No one has managed to hack the different makes laptop bios in order to add intel hd 4000 cpu 3rd gen ivy bridge compatibility.
 
I agree that it should have been already on the latest driver. It seems that intel forgot about it. I hope that intel does recognize this API absence and correct soon, or if I may ASAP, with a driver update.
 
I hope that intel, and specifically Mr **EstebanC\_Intel**, has good news for us in order to compensate for our disappointment with latest intel driver and experience with application compatibility.
 
Cuda is similar to openCL 1.2. OpenCL 1.2 is still not GPU supported on the intel hd 3000 (only supports CPU) which actually is not bad since we still get improvements. However the applications need to support openCL 1.2 in order to see any improvement.
 
Yeah. Intel HD 3000 only support up to openGL 3.1 on Windows. About your openCL screenshot, I think it is from the CPU, not GPU. I used Intel HD 3000 once so I know that it doesn't support openCL (tried with a bitcoin miner which use openCL).
 
Btw, why don't you sell this old laptop and buy a new one? A cheap Haswell laptop will have openCL 1.2, openGL 4 for you to use. Sandy bridge is old now. I haven't seen any new drivers for Intel HD 3000 since last summer.

Elo, I have a problem with my game engine gpu backend on windows only the GL\_TEXTURE0 texture unit is bound if i bind to any other texture unit the sampler returns black. It works fine on linux is this a bug in the windows opengl driver? I have tried to use glBindTextureUnit instead of glBindTexture but theres no difference.
 
And as i have said on linux with mesa and amgpu all texture units work without any issues so i suspect there is a problem with this opengl driver. The layout(binding=X) seems to be working because i am getting different outputs from the samplers which is black color for anything not bound to 0 and the texture if its bound to the texture unit 0 so it must be a problem with the glBindTexture not connecting the textures with units that arent GL\_TEXTURE0.
