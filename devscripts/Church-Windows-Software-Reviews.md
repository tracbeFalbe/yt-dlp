In our quest to provide you the best information on church accounting software, we are taking a look today at Church Windows. First of all, you have to love these guys just based on the sheer cleverness they have put into
 their name. I've looked at some of their creations first-hand and have been very impressed. However, what follows will attempt to be an unbiased review of Church Windows.
 
Experience. This group has been doing accounting software for churches for a long time, since 1987. That is before the Internet was even being used on a mass-level. This means that their product has had the time necessary to work out any quirks that so often come with new software. It also means that a lot of people know how to use it and there will be good forums and self-help guides available.

Another great thing about Church Windows is that it comes as a complete package or as individual modules. Buying individual modules can be extremely difficult if you don't know what you're doing. A lot of church accountants have no idea what it is they need for their accounting system. For these people it is nice to buy a complete package and know they are getting everything they will need.
 
On the other hand it is nice for those people who are only looking for a specific feature such as membership tracking, payroll, or accounting to be able to just buy the individual module they need. These people can save a lot of money and confusion by not going with the whole package.
 
Pricing: This is probably not Church Window's greatest strength, but it is a strength nonetheless. Depending on exactly what you need, you might be able to find a cheaper option. However, usually when you pay a little more, you get a little better quality. Overall this software is priced very competitively.
 
Classes: Church windows is a pretty intuitive program; however, to get its full use you may want to take some of the classes they offer online. The fact that they even offer these classes is a huge bonus. A lot of people end up buying expensive accounting software for their church and end up not really knowing how to use it.
 
I should probably qualify this with the fact that I'm easily bothered by website checkout processes. A lot of the time I wondering what products I'm getting and at what price. I'm also often left wondering what I'll be paying for shipping. Some people say that if you have questions you should call them; well, I for one don't want to call them. If I wanted to chat with someone then I wouldn't be shopping for the church accounting software on the Internet.

I'm not sure how much you can see from this picture, but let me explain why it bothered me. First of all at the top it says "Standard Integrated Packages" $695. At this point, I'm wondering what I'm getting for the $700. After thinking about it a while, it looks like I'm getting the membership and contribution software, but that wasn't readily apparent to me.
 
Now, at the bottom of the picture you will notice they are offering additional options. These always make me nervous because I have no idea if I need this stuff. This one made me especially nervous because it has Accounts Receivable (add $150). At this point I'm thinking, "Wait a minute, isn't accounts receivable part of Accounting?". Then I really start wondering what comes in the accounting package. Is it missing something else that I might really need?
 
One thing that rubbed me a little the wrong with with Church Windows was the fact that they make you pay for the online classes. I realize that customer support isn't cheap, but a lot of companies these days will offer free pre-recorded classes for people who buy their products.
 
Church Windows also charges what is called a support fee. This is pretty standard amongst software providers, but it is something you should really know about before purchasing your church accounting software. Basically you have to pay $100-400 a year in order to get all of the latest updates and be able to call them when you have questions. Again, I realize that customer service isn't cheap, but some customers may be annoyed having to pay $400 a year just to keep the software working correctly.
 
In review, Church Windows is a reliable software that has been around for quite a while. Like most quality products, they have lots of customer support. They also have a great option that will allow you to buy one module or a complete package. Their check-out process is a tad confusing and they will try to hit you up with customer service fees (gotta stay in business somehow). Overall a product that you can't go wrong with, if you have the money.


 
I agree with this reviewer 100%. I am an office manager and a Computer Information Systems (Web Programming) college student. This software IS poorly written. As one example that I noticed when I first began using the program; one should be able to sort reports by year without having to go through other screens and changing settings somewhere else in the program. The same goes for finding records of members who have died.
 
These Church Window Cookies are a classic recipe that calls to mind stained glass windows! These old fashioned cookies combine chocolate, marshmallows and nuts in a simple no bake treat that has only 5 ingredients!
 
This classic cookie is also called Cathedral Window cookies or Stained Glass Window cookies. I have a bunch of vintage church cookbooks from the 1960s and 1970s and every single one includes this tasty recipe!
 
I would consider this more of a candy than a cookie, since it is full of chocolate, marshmallows and nuts, but it is sweet and delicious no matter you call it. The pretty pink, orange and green colored marshmallows give the cookie a vintage stained glass feel.
 
Use your favorite decorative container to package these cookies as a gift for friends, family or neighbors this Christmas season! Add in some old fashioned peanut brittle or chocolate almond fudge for an easy DIY gift.
 
Pour half of the chocolate marshmallow mixture on top of the coconut on each sheet. Squish it into a log shape and roll it up tightly in the paper. Twist the edges like a tootsie roll wrapper to secure.
 
Chill the chocolate marshmallow logs for 2-4 hours until they are firm. Then slice them into 1/4 inch thick cookie slices. I prefer to cut right before serving mainly because it is more convenient to store them in log form.
 
Store the cookie logs wrapped in waxed paper in an airtight container. It is best not to store them in the refrigerator since it can cause the chocolate to bloom, which is when crystals form on the surface.
 
I love to cook and I want to share my recipes with you. I believe cooking should be approachable and fun, not a chore. I want to make simple recipes using everyday ingredients that you can make again and again, whether it is for a busy weeknight, a summer cookout or a special dessert. Read more...

Stained glass windows are a precious heritage to pass on to future generations. However, medieval stained glass windows are particularly altered due to their chemical composition and the effects of climatic (mainly water and temperature), environmental (pollution) and biological factors. In this review, we present the alteration patterns observed on ancient Si-K-Ca stained glass windows. To better understand their formation mechanisms and determine the alteration rates, different exposure campaigns to the current atmosphere in a position sheltered from rain or not and laboratory experiments in aqueous medium or in gaseous phase have been conducted. Either model glass or ancient stained glass windows were studied. Isotopic tracers (D, 18O, 29Si) have been used as they constitute a powerful tool to elucidate the involved processes and to measure their kinetics. Thanks to all of these data, an alteration scenario of medieval stained glass alteration is proposed. Besides, the extrapolation of kinetic data based on several hypotheses over seven centuries gives very consistent results compared to the ancient stained glass samples.
 
This heritage has survived the centuries, exposed to the atmosphere, weathering agents, microorganisms and anthropic activity (pollution and degradation). Many factors can influence the alteration, such as rain quantity, composition and pH, temperature, wind, relative humidity, gas concentration (SO2, NO2, O3, CO2, etc.) and particulate matter in the atmosphere or different microorganisms (bacteria, lichens, algae, fungi, etc.). The combination of these altering factors and the low durability of these glasses (induced by their composition) cause significant modifications of physical and chemical properties on their surface. This leads to the formation of an altered layer and of secondary products. A great diversity of alteration patterns and intensities can be observed. This can be explained both by variable glass chemical compositions and by the environmental parameters that are constantly changing, both outdoors and indoors (e.g. Camuffo et al.9), in time and in space. The progression of the alteration modifies, among other things, the optical and esthetic properties of the material.
 
The techniques and ethics of restoring these pieces have evolved over time toward more and more caution and respect, with gentle methods and constant monitoring of the actions taken. At the same time, conserving the windows requires regular monitoring and overall cleaning interventions aimed at maintaining the g
