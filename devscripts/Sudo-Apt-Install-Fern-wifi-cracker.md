I love hacking (after seeing Mr. Robot of course xD) but i'm new to this, actually i know nothing about and just started installing Kali 2.0 couple of days ago. I started messing up with some airmon-ng and aircrack commands. At first i type in "airmon-ng kill check" then it said it killed something i didn't remember, then after a couple of failed attempts on cracking WPA, i quit the Terminal and i started suffering web normally but then i realize that somehow my wifi cannot connect ??? try many ways online to fix but still no hope....then i messed up again with typing "iw del wlan0mon" or "iw del wlan0" (not quite sure remember) then i don't see the Wifi option anyone... TT.TT in airmon-ng it also showed nothing (not even wlan0 or something, just blank)....So is there anyway for me to reset my Wifi state on my device, i mean reset everything back to normal, please help me, i'm new to this and i don't have much knowledge. Any help would be very appreciated. Thanks !!!!

If all that Dont work then try rebooting and boot into recovery mode and then it asks for root password and you type your root password after that it gives you a terminal-like space so u type "sudo ifconfig wlan0(or any other network interface) up" it should work. You can test it by typing ifconfig. If you see the wlan0 interface information then it worked your Wireless card is back. Up and running. Thank you.
 
Interesting. I had a similar issue where my wifi would stay connected for a few moments at a time and then drop suddenly without saying it was disabled or that there was a change in connectivity. I solved it by going into Wifi Settings and disabling ipv6 in my current network's settings. I dunno if this will fix your issue or not, but it worked like a champ for me.
 
The reason you had this problem is because when you are killing these processes with airmon-ng kill the airmon-ng program kills all processes that can cause interference with your wireless chip being placed into monitor mode. Now this isn't always required, but if you want to connect to wifi after putting your card into monitor mode, you can reboot, or do the commands listed above. Next time try

Hey, i think i did the same thing but I'm not sure.
I already tried all those commands but no success.
Wlan is not listed on network-manager tab so I can't search for Wi-Fi.
I can still use wlan0 with monitor mode(airmon-ng) but I can't conect to any network. Reboot didn't solve the problem.

Red Team Menu is born for organizing in pretty manner the main pentesting tools that users need to start their hacking activity. It is deployed in different manner according to the installed environment.
 
In Athena Nix, by Red Team menu, the tools are run in an ephimeral environment by Nix Shell. It means that once the user exits from Nix Shell, the tool is unlinked/removed. To keep a specific tool permanent on the system, you can set a Cyber Role or edit /etc/nixos/configuration.nix by adding explicitely the tool you need and run sudo nixos-rebuild switch.
 
At the beginning, these tools are not installed to avoid that users would store in the disk space installed tools or services that never use. For users that would like to get these main tools, the **Enthusiast Student** role must be chosen on the Welcome App.
