Allah said: "He has succeeded who purifies the soul, and he has failed who corrupts the soul." (Qur'an, 91:9-10)  
And Allah said: "A day when there will be no benefit in wealth or children, but only in he who comes to Allah with a pure heart." (Qur'an, 26:88-89)  
We learn from these verses that our success in the Hereafter depends upon the purification of our hearts in this life. We must purify our hearts from spiritual sins such as greed, malice, envy, arrogance, and worldliness. In their place, we must adorn the heart with spiritual virtues such as generosity, compassion, benevolence, humility, and asceticism.  
Purification of the heart was one of the first commands with which Moses (peace be upon him) was sent to Pharaoh.  
Allah said: "Go to Pharaoh, for verily, he is a transgressor. Say to him: 'Will you purify yourself'?" (Qur'an, 79:17-18)  
Purity of heart is also one of the defining characteristics of Abraham (peace be upon him).  
Allah said: "Verily, among his people was Abraham, when he came to his Lord with a pure heart." (Qur'an, 37:83-84)  
One of the primary methods we can use to purify our hearts is to perform sincere supplications and prayers according to the prophetic way (sunnah).  
Allah said: "He has succeeded who purifies himself, who remembers the name of his Lord and prays." (Qur'an, 87:14-15)  
When we exalt Allah and ask for our sins to be forgiven, this removes arrogance from our hearts and makes us humble. When we pray for Allah to guide others, this removes malice and hatred from our hearts and makes us love others for the sake of Allah. When we remember the Hereafter and the Day of Resurrection, this makes us less attached to the world and more inclined to help others.  
In this way, the Messenger of Allah would purify his heart every morning and evening by performing supplications and prayers.  
Anas ibn Malik reported: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to me: 'O boy, if you are able to remove every morning and evening any rancor from your heart toward anyone, then do so.' Then the Prophet said to me: 'O boy, that is my tradition and whoever revives my tradition, has loved me, and whoever loves me will be with me in Paradise'." (Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 2678)  
The ritual prayer is meant to prevent us from committing sins and immoral deeds. Allah said: "Verily, the prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater." (Qur'an, 29:45)  
Abu Huraira reported: "A man came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he said, 'Indeed, so-and-so prays in the night but he steals in the morning.' The Prophet said: 'Verily, it should prevent him from doing that'." (Musnad Ahmad, 9486)  
The next method we can use to purify our hearts is to give in charity and perform good deeds for others. Allah said: "But the righteous one will avoid Hellfire, who gives from his wealth to purify himself." (Qur'an, 92:17-18)  
And Allah said: "Take from their wealth a charity by which you cleanse them and purify them, and invoke blessings upon them." (Qur'an, 92:103)  
When we give away our wealth in charity, this removes worldliness from our hearts and envy of what others have and it makes us hope for our good deeds stored in the Hereafter. Charity means not only giving wealth, but also giving people your time, your effort, your work, and even a smile or a kind word.  
Jabir ibn Abdullah reported: "The Messenger of Allah peace be upon him said: 'Every good deed is charity. Verily, it is a good deed to meet your brother with a smiling face, and to pour what is left from your bucket into the vessel of your brother'." (Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 1970)  
Charity is a duty upon every Muslim, for every person can give something from his wealth, time, and energy. At the very least, Muslims can refrain from harming others and that is also charity.  
Abu Huraira reported: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Charity is due upon every joint of the people for every day upon which the sun rises. Being just between two people is charity, and helping a man with his animal and lifting his luggage upon it is charity, and a kind word is charity, and every step that you take toward the mosque is charity, and removing harmful things from the road is charity'." (Sahih Muslim, 1009)  
When a Muslim commits a sin, his or her heart is covered by a stain, but it is removed by repentance and good deeds.  
Abu Huraira reported: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Verily, when the believer commits a sin, a black spot appears upon his heart. If he repents and abandons the sin and seeks forgiveness, his heart will be polished, but if he increases in sin, the blackness increases. That is the covering which Allah has mentioned in his Book: 'Nay, but on their hearts is a covering because of what they have earned,' (83:14)" (Sunan ibn Majah, 4244)  
Therefore, a Muslim must continue to perform supplications, prayers, charity, and good deeds until the heart is purified from sin.  
In conclusion, the salvation of a Muslim depends upon purification of the heart soul from vices and adorning the heart with virtues. Purification is achieved through performing sincere supplications, prayers, and acts of charity toward others. We must remember that we will be judged on the Day of Resurrection according to the purity of our hearts and the righteousness of our deeds.  
Abu Huraira reported: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Verily, Allah does not look at your appearance or wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and actions'." (Sahih Muslim 2564)  
Success comes from Allah, and Allah knows best.

One should embed in their heart and continue to remember those deeds that cause one to attain purification and vice versa, for those deeds that are constantly remembered are fixed and implanted into the heart. I shall explain with the following example:
 
Success becomes possible through progressing gradually and making it a daily practice. Hence, compel yourself to perform a good deed just one time and then do so again at another juncture. In this manner, perform this deed many a time which shall eventually become a habit.

There must be consistency in worship. It should not be that one performs their worship for a period of time and then ceases. In doing so, whatever was attained previously, would not render any benefit, as Allah has declared:
 
One must bear with patience when they are admonished for a mistake. Many people are unable to reform themselves precisely because they get off ended when their error is pointed out and they do not fix this error. Yet, they should not act like this; they should tolerate when they are reprimanded for an error they commit. God Almighty declares:
 
In other words, there are some people who, if told to fear Allah, become indignant at this advice and become insane at the thought of being degraded and instead of heeding this advice, they begin to oppose and contest the advisor. The abode of such people is Hell, for instead of being appreciative and grateful to the individual who pointed out the mistake, they quarrel with him.
 
The verse quoted above emphasizes the importance of purifying our hearts in this life as it is the key to our success in the Hereafter. According to this verse, on the Day of Judgment, our wealth and children will be of no use to us, and the only thing that will benefit us is a pure heart.
 
As Muslims, it is essential to heed this call and strive to purify our hearts of negative qualities such as sin, malice, envy, worldliness, greed, and arrogance. Instead, we should replace these negative traits with positive qualities such as generosity, compassion, benevolence, and gratitude.
 
Verily, among his people was Abraham, when he came to his Lord with a pure heart. [3]Thus, the purification of our hearts holds an important position in our life and the Hereafter. So, some of the steps we could take on to purify our hearts are as follows:
 
Islam has five basic pillars namely, Tawheed( Oneness of Almighty), Namaz, Roza, Zakat and Hajj. The second pillar of Islam, Namaz, also known as prayer, holds great significance in the Islamic faith. It is considered an act of submission to Allah and offers numerous benefits to those who perform it regularly. Namaz helps individuals build a connection with Allah, and through this connection, they are able to draw closer to their Lord and obtain a pure heart.
 
While there are no restrictions on invoking Allah, Namaz is considered the preferred way of doing so. This is because through Namaz, one is able to establish a deeper connection with Allah and any invocation made within this state of devotion is more likely to be accepted by Allah compared to other circumstances.
 
O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient. [4]We are exposed to environments and people which significantly impact our souls and hearts. Undoubtedly the current plight of the people of the world is miserable where they are more attracted towards ills and lewdness compared to goodness, which makes our hearts ill and damaged and impure thus, we can quickly go down the road of darkness. So to prevent ourselves from being a companion of Satan, Namaz is what we need to hold on to and find refuge in it.
 
He has succeeded who purifies himself, who remembers the name of his Lord and prays. [7]Asking for forgiveness through invocation helps to humble us and rid our hearts of arrogance. When we pray for guidance for others, it helps to cultivate compassion within us
