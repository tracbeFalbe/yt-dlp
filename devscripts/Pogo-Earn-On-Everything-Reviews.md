**Yes, Pogo is legit and pays you for selling your data and answering surveys. It has a 4.9 average star rating on the app store and there's plenty of positive reviews and payment proof online. And when I tested out the app, it paid me for connecting my cards to the app and shopping**.

Once you connect your bank account to Pogo, it's time to get paid to shop! Every time you shop, Pogo pays you with points, and there's no need to upload pictures of your receipts or manually enter transactions.
 
This is only pennies, but again, Pogo is completely passive, and you earn points on every transaction. In contrast, many reward apps only pay you with points if you shop at specific partners or buy specific products.
 
Another way to earn points with Pogo is to answer short in-app surveys. These are sometimes from brand partners, like Kroger or Walmart, but can also be anonymous surveys for market research purposes.
 
Surveys aren't guaranteed, but they're a nice way to supplement your transaction-based points and cash out faster. Although I will say that in the few weeks I tested out Pogo when I was in the United States, I didn't receive any surveys.
 
**With Pogo boosts, you earn bonus cash back by activating a merchant and then shopping at it online. This is similar to rewards websites like Rakuten, and Pogo works with dozens of merchants like Best Buy, Groupon, Nike, Macy's, Gamestop, Sam's Club, and Walmart**.
 
All you have to do is sign in to various providers for bills like car insurance, internet bills, phone bills, and other types of insurance. From there, Pogo compares your current rate to rates from other providers to try and find a better deal.
 
Another way to earn passive income with the Pogo app is to enable location rewards. This lets the app track your location through your phone, and when you pass by or enter a partner store, you earn some bonus points.

Pogo calls these data dividends, and it's a nice way to earn money just for sharing your location data. You can also enable a similar feature and get paid bonus points for letting Pogo access your emails to find purchases, although I like this idea much less.
 
**Yes, the Pogo app is safe, and you can securely link your cards to your account. This is because Pogo uses Plaid to connect to your bank account and keeps your personal data anonymous and secure**.
 
Plaid is the same solution many leading investment apps and FinTech companies use to safely handle their customer's data. And I've used plenty of apps that use Plaid to access my financial information and have never had any issues.
 
As Pogo explains, one in four Americans have used Plaid, and it's the solution apps like Acorns, Venmo, and Chime use. And Pogo doesn't have access to your login credentials, only data like the merchants you shop at and how much you spend.
 
After testing out Pogo for a few weeks while I was in the United States, I think it's a legit passive income app. It doesn't pay very much, and I didn't get any surveys, but you can probably earn $5 to $25 per year with this app on the low end.
 
However, Heather likes how passive the app is, and she was able to successfully cash out with Pogo after two months. I'm still testing the app and will update this review if/when I can cash out as well.

I've been making money with these sorts of offers for years. And I think this is a relatively easy side hustle that can have decent returns...
 
Answering surveys for cash is an incredibly popular way to make money online. But, as you probably know if you use survey websites to make extra cash, a lot of them have incredibly high payout requirements. This inevitably means waiting weeks or even months to see any material benefit for your hard work. If you want quick...
 
So, you're wondering how to make $5,000 dollars a month and want some ideas to get started. Earning 5K a month equals $60,000 in a year!

Instead of letting large businesses benefit from your personal info without giving anything in return, Pogo offers tools that help you harness the power of your own data. Once you sign up, you can save, earn, and monetize everything directly. So far, over half a million American households have benefited from signing up, and that number keeps growing each day.
 
Niantic and Pokemon/ingress etc. should really find a way to reward reviewers and nomatatinees more in games . Because reviews should not take 2 Weeks. If people are more prompt to do it. I am it can be something stupid like stardust or a 50 coins for reviewing an x amount of reviews. Or more global challenges for scanning PokeStop and reviewing.
 
E.g. 100 points could buy you an upgrade or extra appeal , Pogo players could trade that in for so much stardust, a lucky egg or an incubator, in ingress 100 might get you a kinetic capsule or apex and so on. As many options to attract a variety of people from different games at different levels.
 
With the Seer badge I think it was simply that all new portals had to be reviewed by Niantic staff and the system broke down. When Wayfarer came in to replace it, it also cleared the old backlog so some people still earned Seer badges later.
 
There have been a lot of positive things done/ changed in the past few months, Accepting a few items for hours worth of reviewing will never be worth it. I would be insulted if i was offered that kinda garbage.
 
Indeed, Niantic is striving to improve and sift through the less desirable submissions. A system where reviewers know they could gain or lose something based on the quality of their submissions might reduce the number of low-quality contributions.
 
I agree that rewards may need to be looked at. I am one that does more reviewing and edits than nominating, so I have banked up a good amount of upgrades. Where I live most new eligible POIs get Wayspots quickly, especially from those that live/work in that neighborhood.
 
I think one thing that would help would be if edits were finally added to Contribution Management, and we were allowed to use upgrades on those. Especially if you are someone that lives in an area where it can take months for an edit to go through community review, an upgrade would help increase the number of people that can reivew it, which would reduce the time edits get decided on.
