My boss handed me a Sony a6300 and expected me to just know how to use it since "you know video and made short films." Doesn't work that way. I cannot find how to change the shutter speed on this bloody camera. Can someone clue me in? Auto settings are total garbage. Google is blocked here and searching with a vpn has been painful. Hours at it and I cannot get an actual answer. Why is it always so hard to find this one setting on cameras?

Also, he just expected to be able to have "movie footage" with the kit lens, not having a clue how to get a shallow depth of field. Can someone recommend an affordable lens for this camera that can get me down to maybe 1.8? The two lenses he has are 3.5 and 4.0. Uhhh, not gonna do the trick.
 
the shutter,Im pretty sure..will either be the rotating wheel at the back or the wheel on the top right.. you can change in the menu which one.. between Iris and Shutter.. for either of those two wheels.. there is a cheap 1.8 50mm ($300) approx Sony lens.. the a6300 doesn't have internal body stabilization so you will have to buy a Sony lens to have steady shot..(a6500 does).. its not a bad little camera really.. great for gimbals..
 
50mm is not all that wide to me. I wonder if there is anything a bit wider that isn't fish eye? Searching Amazon from here is ridiculously painful to do. It usually errors out. Searching anything from here is tough.
 
Its going to be tough to get Shallow DoF on a wide angle lens .. even a fast one.. in a room.. unless its massive one.. have a check of 50mm .. you can get 2 shot loose head and shoulders if you have the space..and they are sitting close together.. and your background will have some level of "out of focus" look..

Yeah some of the spaces in which I am being asked to shoot are confining. Unfortunately the folks wanting video have zero clue about how it is done or what one needs to achieve a shallow depth of field. And they expect everything to be easy and fast. \*sigh\*
 
I have that Sony 35mm lens. Its great but don't forget that it's designed for that APS-C sensor. So you will approximately get the same field of view as a 50mm lens when working in 35mm format. I use this lens for portraits and close ups. For a wide lens I wound up getting a good deal on eBay for the Zeiss Touit 12mm which winds up looking like the field of view of an 18mm. But again a shallow depth of field with a wide lens is only going to be apparent when focused on subjects very close to the lens.
 
I have a Sony NEX6 and Sony A6500, both APS-C sensors -- I have a 16mm wide-angle lens with some adaptors to make it even more wide-angle, for security camera type shots, but for my still photography I don't use it. I have a 20mm, 24mm, 35mm, and 50mm plus a 16-70mm T/4 zoom and the tiny kit 16-50mm variable stop zoom. I also have a telephoto zoom. The 20mm is a very small lens, which is nice.
 
My review of the Sony a6500 is based on using the camera for several weeks for both paid work and personal work. Mainly I wanted to see if it was a viable backup to my main camera, the Sony a7iii and if it would serve as a good option for casual family/travel/adventure photos.
 
Sure, they might not be as burly as the high end DSLR but they are lightweight making a drop less impactful and ergonomics less vital. More on ergonomics in a minute. My other Sony bodies have handled several drops without consequence. Perhaps I should review camera straps next!
 
Instead of having a full metal body, the Sony a6500 is a combination of plastic and metal components. Nevertheless it retains a sturdiness that made me feel comfortable about tossing it in my backpack without fear of damaging it.
 
The main difference between the Sony a6500 and the a7 series is the size of the body. The a6500 is even smaller. Therefore, the controls were a bit more compact and not quite as quick to adjust. There are fewer dedicated custom buttons which is only a concern if you are using the camera at events and need to work very quickly.
 
Two things that I found myself wishing for were a front dial and a joystick button. I rely a lot on the front dial to quickly adjust shutter speed to fine tune my exposure and using the back dial was just not as effective.
 
Despite lacking these two things, I was able to customize the buttons and dials to make my main adjustments quickly even for a person with moderate to large hands. The buttons and knobs are small, but are a definite upgrade from the Sony a6000. Each of the dials felt **tight and tactile** making accurate adjustments easy.
 
The electronic viewfinder on the Sony a6500 is **crisp, vibrant, and bright**. Even in low light, the viewfinder was accurate and helped me achieve proper exposure. I did find that it is a little dim to shoot in full sun, even with maximum brightness.
 
On a few occasions the illuminated screen caused me to underexpose a little but that works well with my style of shooting. I often find myself underexposing to preserve the brightest parts of the image. It is easier to recover shadows than highlights.
 
Along with the small form factor, the Sony a6500 comes with a small battery. This became an issue for me mainly in cold weather. At more comfortable temps, the battery seemed adequate, however, I would definitely recommend keeping a few extras with you, if you plan on shooting a lot.
 
It produces spectacular 24mp images with tons of dynamic range while retaining its compact and easy to manipulate body. Overall, I think it is a **fantastic camera**for everyday adventures and travel.
 
The Sony a6500 has a wide range of lens options. Though it seems like more recently Sony has focused on their full frame lens lineup (fully compatible with a6500), there are still a **wide range of options** specifically designed for crop sensors.
 
One question people often ask is which should I choose, the Sony a7ii or the Sony a6500. I think this question comes up because they are similar in price. The difference lies in their feature set. They are intended for different purposes.
 
In many ways the a6500 is quite similar to the a6300 (see review). The 24.2MP APS-C sensor and 4D focus systems the same, as are its video capabilities, 11 FPS, and viewfinder. Its form factor and dial arrangement are also the same as both the a6300 and the entry-level a6000.
 
While the sensor is the same as in the a6300, the a6500 has a faster large-scale integration (LSI) chip and image processing algorithm. This is a serious help in the noise-reduction arena, where it keeps detail while effectively reducing noise at the mid-high ISOs.
 
Both cameras have an E-mount, have decent continuous burst speeds (10fps for the a7iii and 11fps for the a6500), and live view with blackouts up to 8fps. They also both have WiFi, NFC, Bluetooth connectivity
 
The a6500 inherited the flat-topped design of the a6300 and a6000 APS-C models. It also has a viewfinder at the top left of the body rather than in the middle. The grip, though larger than the a6300, is still quite a bit smaller than the a7iii as well.
 
The Sony a7iii, on the other hand, has a bigger, sturdier build. The increased size (and weight!) allow it to offer more dials and buttons for easier control. These include an additional control dial, as well as an AF-ON button and an AF joystick.
 
The a7iii comes with a brand new BSI full-frame CMOS sensor which allow for superior light collection. Combined with the latest BIONZ X image processor, the a7iii is just amazing in low light situations. Its base range ISO starts at 100 and goes to 51200, expandable down to 50 or up to 204800. (Extended values only go to 102400 for video.)
 
Another key AF difference, though, is that the a7iii comes with an AF Area Recognition mode. This allows you to assign frequently used focus point settings to custom buttons for fast recall. It also has an AF Track Sensor that allows you to adjust the responsiveness in continuous mode.
 
**Shutter speed** is another place where the two cameras differ. They both use an vertical-traverse focal plane type shutter that produces fewer vibrations than previous shutters, but the a7iii is considerably faster, reaching into the 1/8000s. The a6500, in comparison, reaches its limit at 1/4000.
 
In the **video realm**, the a6500 and the a7iii are pretty similar. Both cameras can record in 4K up to 30fps and 100Mbps, and Full HD up to 120fps. (Here, the UHS-II cards will come in handy.) The only real differences that I can see are that the a7iii has HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) and can record in both full frame and APS-C format.
 
Another option is to get a third-party. The a6500 comes with an 1100mAh battery (good for bout 310 shots without strobe) but third party 1500mAh options are easy to find, like these I recommend, which increase battery life by around 30%.
 
However, the Sony a6500 certainly works as a viable backup to keep in the bag in case your main body has a problem. Where it really shines is as a small/lightweight camera for traveling or having on you all the time to **document the adventures of life**.
 
Normally I shoot video in manual mode with ISO set to Auto. So, while recording, the ISO continually adjusts depending on lighting. Is there a setting somewhere that prevents ISO from changing while actively recording something - and only adjusting again in-between shots?
 
My use case is such that I want the camera to adjust ISO for exposure, but then lock that in throughout the shot and then re-adjust for the next one. That way, I don't have to manually select my ISO for each shot, but also have locked in settings throughout the shot that are easier to work with in post.
