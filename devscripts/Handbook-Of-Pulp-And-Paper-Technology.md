TAPPI currently partners with the **Forest Products Engineers** based in Finland. As part of our partnership, we offer the Papermaking Science and Technology book series featuring 20 volumes that cover the entire paper manufacturing process from wood raw material to end product. Books are available in print directly from TAPPI.
 
This series is ideal to train employees at your company or as a reference guide for your experienced workforce. The Papermaking Science and Technology series is also an excellent textbook resource for universities and colleges.

In brief, this textbook describes the main features of forests and forestry, including the production of timber and biomass and its delivery to the industry in the context of sustainability. The focus in this book is on forests and forestry in the boreal and temperate zones, particularly in the Nordic countries. The discussion also includes the global dimensions of forests and forestry to place local findings in a larger context whenever necessary.
 
This book describes the basics of forest products chemistry with this whole chain in view. The book begins with an overview of the structure and chemical composition of wood, followed by a description of the basic chemical processes taking place during wood delignification.
 
In general, this book is intended as a basic introduction to papermaking chemistry not only for students and teachers, but also for those working either in the laboratory as researchers or in production and planning.
 
This book presents an overview of the design and operations of the drying section of a modern paper machine. It covers drying of the paper web, runnability in the paper machine drying section, drying quality, drying automation and energy management in the drying section, as well as operations of important auxiliary systems, such as ventilation and heat recovery systems, steam and condensate systems and paper machine drives.

This book examines the status of and future views on the systems, methods and technology that are becoming essential in guiding process operation and maintenance, together with control and maintenance design. The emphasis is on management-level systems and on process and maintenance optimization.
 
The book provides detailed information on environmental issues related to pulp and paper mills and their associated processes, and is intended to help increase understanding of the factors affecting environmental load, including liquid effluents, air emissions and solid wastes.
 
*Biermann's Handbook of Pulp and Paper: Paper and Board Making,* *Third Edition*provides a thorough introduction to paper and board making, providing paper technologists recent information. The book emphasizes principles and concepts behind papermaking, detailing both the physical and chemical processes. It has been updated, revised and extended. Several new chapters have been added. Papermaking chemistry has found an adequate scope covering this important area by basics and practical application. Scientific and technical advances in refining, including the latest developments have been presented. The process of stock preparation describes the unit processes. An exhaustive overview of Chemical additives in Pulp and Paper Industry is included. Paper and pulp processing and additive chemicals are an integral part of the total papermaking process from pulp slurry, through sheet formation, to effluent disposal. Water circuits with loop designs and circuit closure are presented. The chapter on paper and board manufacture covers the different sections in the paper machine and also fabrics, rolls and roll covers, and describes the different types of machines producing the various paper and board grades. Coating is dealt with in a separate chapter covering color formulation and preparation and also coating application. Paper finishing gives an insight into what happens at roll slitting and handling. The chapter on environmental impact includes waste water treatment and handling, air emissions, utilization and solid residue generation and mitigation . The major paper and board grades and their properties, are described. Biotechnological methods for paper processing are also presented. This handbook is essential reading for Applied Chemists, Foresters, Chemical Engineers, Wood Scientists, and Pulp and Paper technologist/ Engineers, and anyone else interested or involved in the pulp and paper industry.
 
**Dr. Michael J. Kocurek, Course Chair
**Dr. Kocurek, professor emeritus of Paper Science & Engineering at North Carolina State University, is one of the world's most recognized educators in the pulp and paper industry.
 
He has taught students and thousands of industry operators and professionals at more than 200 mills and 50 paper industry corporations, government and other organizations, including TAPPI, the Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the American and Forest Association (AF&PA). Additionally, he has taught undergraduate and graduate students since 1970.
 
He is the course chair for TAPPI's oldest and highly ranked short course on Introduction to Pulp & Paper Technology (50 years). He is the editor of 11 books, including the recognized Pulp and Paper Manufacture series covering the entire field of pulp & paper. He has authored and/or co-authored 25 video publications, including the Introduction to Pulp & Paper series- again covering the entire field of pulp & paper.
 
Dr. Kocurek received his B.S., M.S., and PhD degrees in Paper Science & Engineering from the SUNY College of Environmental Science & Forestry, and Syracuse University. He has served as paper science department head at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, an academic program he founded; and NC State University. He also has served as executive director of the Herty Foundation, an authority agency of the State of Georgia. While at Herty, he oversaw a $27 million modernization of the laboratory, creating the largest pilot scale P&P and advanced fiber development center in the US.
 
His honors include TAPPI Fellow, TAPPI Distinguished Service Award, TAPPI Paper and Board Division Technical Achievement Award; and induction into the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame - an honor bestowed to recognize people who have made preeminent contributions to the global paper industry.
