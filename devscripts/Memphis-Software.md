**Jeffery has immersed himself in tennis for over a decade, starting as a kid and developing a deep passion for the sport. As he honed his skills, he gained a reputation as a skilled player, inspiring him to share his knowledge with the youth and anyone interested in this beloved game.**
 
**The next stage becomes more challenging for players as they improve their skills, movement, and play situations. Here they need to use class time to make the ball go faster, add spins, and connect a variety of shots together using patterns of play. Moving forward in the court and using angles will also become a priority at this level. They will now be developing all five play situations; baseline rally, serve, return, moving forward, and your opponent moving forward. Mentally they learn to focus, embrace, and enjoy challenging situations.**
 
**The third phase of the program has them transitioning to the full court. Players at this stage are more confident and tactically aware. Goals are now more focused around their opponent and how to attack and defend. Focus is placed on developing more tactical skills and refining technical ones, building upon the quality foundations from previous stages, including attacking, defending and using strengths and weaknesses. As they continue to grow and develop, basic strength and athletic skills play a bigger part in their game; physical size must be considered as players transition.**
 
**Players now have transitioned fully to the regulation court and have a good understanding of all the play situations. Tactical and technical aspects of development are the main focus. Players will continue to develop their own game style and have the ability to make adjustments under pressure. A good understanding of high percentage play and pattern for singles and doubles fundamentals will be a focal point. Hard work, sportsmanship, and discipline is a must as the intensity and demand of the program is increased. Staying mentally and emotionally positive through the process is expected from all participants.**
